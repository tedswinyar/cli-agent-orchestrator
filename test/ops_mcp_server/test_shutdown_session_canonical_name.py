"""shutdown_session against the REAL delete route and deletion service.

The bare-name contract cannot be proven with a mocked DELETE. ``DELETE
/sessions/{name}`` is idempotent: ``session_service.delete_session()`` puts an
absent name straight into ``deleted``, so the route answers HTTP 200 for a
session that never existed. A test that mocks a 404 DELETE therefore asserts a
response the API never produces, and a bare-name delete that silently no-ops
while ``cao-<name>`` stays live would pass it.

So these tests drive the ops tool's real ``requests`` call into an in-process
``TestClient`` over the real FastAPI app (the seam ``test/mcp_server/conftest.py``
established for the in-session MCP tools), with the REAL ``delete_session``
reconciliation running underneath it against the in-memory tmux backend and the
per-test SQLite registry that ``test/services/test_session_teardown_atomic.py``
already models the teardown side effects with. What is asserted is the thing the
coordinator cares about: the session is actually gone from the backend and the
registry, and the tool issued exactly one destructive request.

The routed responses are httpx responses rather than ``requests`` ones. That is
faithful for this surface: the ops helpers only read ``status_code``/``json()``/
``text``, and both libraries raise a ``ValueError`` subclass from ``json()`` on a
non-JSON body. No in-process transport can raise ``requests.RequestException``,
which is what the mocked unit tests in ``test_server.py`` still cover.
