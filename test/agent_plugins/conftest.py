"""Shared fixtures for the Agent Plugins test package.

``constants.py`` derives every path from ``CAO_HOME_DIR`` at **import** time, so
these tests cannot relocate the store by setting an env var — the module is
long since imported by the time a test runs. Every entry point in
``agent_plugins`` therefore accepts an explicit store/skills-dir override, and
these fixtures supply tmp-path-backed ones. That is also why the production code
takes those parameters at all: an installer that could only ever write to the
real home directory would be untestable without monkeypatching module globals.

    genuinely is its target -- ``cao skills add --force`` acquiring the lifecycle

    Scalars are **quoted** deliberately, via ``json.dumps`` (valid YAML for a

    ``true``, ``no``, ``null``, ``on`` or ``1.0`` would parse as a bool, null or
    number and then compare unequal to its own folder name — this helper would be
    generating an *invalid* skill while every caller believed it was valid, and a
    test asserting the skill is reachable would fail for a reason that has
    nothing to do with the code under test.

    That is a live hazard here rather than a theoretical one: the collision
    properties draw plugin and skill names from sampled sets, and the next
    adversarial name added to one of those sets is as likely to be ``no`` as
    ``zzx``.

    The underlying hazard is real for plugin authors too — an unquoted
    ``name: true`` in a hand-written ``SKILL.md`` is silently rejected by CAO's
    existing skill loader — but it lives in that loader rather than in anything
    this feature introduces, so it is out of scope here beyond not tripping over
