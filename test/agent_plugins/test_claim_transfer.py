"""Ownership transfer to a user-installed skill (finding F2).

``release_projection_claim`` returned ``None`` both for "no plugin held this name"
and for "a plugin held it and the record write failed". ``cao skills add --force``
read the failure as the former, unlinked the projection, copied the user's directory
into place, and left the plugin record still claiming the name; the next rebuild's
sweep then removed that directory *by name only* — no symlink check, no containment
check — and ``shutil.rmtree`` took the user's real skill with it. The failure premise
is real: records live under the store's ``state_dir`` while projections live in
``SKILLS_DIR``, so a full or read-only state volume fails the record write while the
copy into the skill store succeeds.

Two independent layers are tested: the tri-state release the caller aborts on, and a
sweep that refuses to delete anything that is not structurally a projection.
