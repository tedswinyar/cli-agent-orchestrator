"""Property tests for install/remove state transitions and projection (W5).

**Validates: Requirements 9.4, 10.3, 14.2, 14.3, 15.4; Properties P4, P6, P8**

These are *algebraic* properties of the
installed set — idempotence, inverse pairs, order-independence — which is the
class of bug a table of examples reliably misses, because each individual
operation looks right and only a sequence exposes the fault.

Deliberately **not** duplicated, because ``test_installer.py`` and
``test_projection.py`` already carry an equivalent Hypothesis property:
``test_add_then_remove_restores_the_prior_state``
(``test_property_install_then_remove_restores_the_prior_state``),
``test_add_then_force_add_equals_a_single_add``
(``test_property_force_reinstall_equals_a_single_install``),
``test_failed_install_changes_nothing``
(``test_property_invalid_install_changes_nothing``),
``test_valid_skills_only_plugin_fully_loads_and_projects``
(``test_property_skills_only_plugins_fully_conform``),
``test_lexicographically_smallest_plugin_wins`` and
``test_winner_is_invariant_under_install_order_permutation``
(``test_property_winner_is_invariant_under_install_order``),
``test_winner_is_stable_across_repeated_rebuilds``
(``test_property_repeated_rebuilds_never_flip_the_winner``),
