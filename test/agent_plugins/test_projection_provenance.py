"""Copy-mode projections prove ownership by marker and content digest.

Reported by review 3 on #584:

> "Do not treat every regular file as a managed projection. […] For copy-mode
> directories, persist a marker or other exact provenance before recursively
> deleting; a prior name claim alone cannot prove that the current bytes are
> CAO-owned."

The old predicate answered "yes, CAO's" for *any* regular file and for *any*
directory whenever the projection happened to be running in copy mode. Neither is
provenance. A copied projection now carries ``.cao-projection.json`` holding a
digest of the bytes CAO wrote, and only three things count as ownership: a symlink
resolving inside the plugin store, a directory whose marker digest still verifies,
or a directory byte-identical to the source the caller names (the adoption rule,
which is how copies written before this fix stay manageable).

The direction of every residual is over-preservation: an unproven directory is
left in place and reported, never deleted.

Mutation-verified: restoring ``if path.is_file(): return True`` fails the
regular-file tests; skipping the digest comparison fails the edited-copy and
forged-marker tests.

    §4.1 permits ``skills/<name>`` to itself be a symlink whose target resolves

    reject that shape (``test_skill_symlink_inside_the_root_is_permitted``). So
    ``skills/inspection -> ../shared/implementation`` is a *permitted* package, and
    it installs cleanly in copy mode.

    ``_write_marker`` recorded ``realpath(source)``, whose basename is the symlink
    TARGET's name — ``implementation`` — while the projected skill is
    ``inspection``. ``_verified_marker`` binds a marker to the directory holding it
    by requiring that basename to equal ``path.name``, so **CAO rejected its own
    unchanged marker.**

    The adoption rule cannot paper over it where it matters: ``uninstall`` removes
    the package *before* the sweep runs, so there is no source left to compare
    bytes against. The removal therefore reported success with
    ``projection.sweep_skipped_unmanaged`` while the skill stayed in the shared
    catalog — visible to every provider, owned by nothing.
