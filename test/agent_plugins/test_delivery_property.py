"""Property tests for cross-provider delivery (W6, W11).

**Validates: Requirements 13.2, 13.6, 13.7, 18.9, 18.10; Property P10**

Covers skill-delivery properties across every provider, plus the MCP-delivery
properties that only become meaningful once plugin MCP servers are delivered
into agent profiles (Increment 2).

Deliberately **not** duplicated: ``test_reachable_set_equals_the_union_for_every_provider``,
``test_every_provider_agrees_with_every_other`` and
``test_projected_plugin_skills_reach_every_provider_regardless`` are all the same
property as ``test_delivery_equivalence.py``'s
``test_property_delivery_equivalence_across_providers``, which already exists here
and reads each provider's real artifact. ``test_invalid_plugin_skills_reach_no_provider``,
``test_catalog_based_providers_do_see_extra_dir_skills`` and
``test_filesystem_direct_providers_do_not_see_extra_dir_skills`` exist here as
concrete parametrized tests in that same file (the last two as Criteria 13.6/13.7).

The one genuinely irreplaceable test in this file is
``TestTheRejectedAlternativeWouldNotHaveWorked``. It is not a test of CAO's
behaviour at all — it is a test of the *counterfactual* the design rests on. The
design's single most consequential choice is projecting into ``SKILLS_DIR``
instead of registering plugin roots as extra skill directories, and the stated
reason is that the alternative cannot reach Kiro or OpenCode. That claim is
falsifiable, so it should be asserted rather than believed.
