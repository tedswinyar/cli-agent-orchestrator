"""Per-worker runtime ``KIMI_CODE_HOME`` for Kimi Code (agent-core-v2).

Kimi Code resolves its entire user-global data root from ``KIMI_CODE_HOME``
(default ``~/.kimi-code``). That is the *only* redirect the CLI exposes for MCP
membership — A0 established that no launch-scoped MCP flag and no MCP-config env
override exist (``--mcp-config`` / ``--mcp-config-file`` are absent from the
0.43.1 option table). So per-worker MCP isolation means per-worker home:

    same real project cwd
    worker A -> runtime KIMI_CODE_HOME A -> mcp.json A
    worker B -> runtime KIMI_CODE_HOME B -> mcp.json B

A single shared home is **not** a valid substitute, because two CAO profiles may
declare different ``profile.mcpServers`` surfaces (worker A: ``cao`` + ``github``;
worker B: ``cao`` + ``postgres``). One ``mcp.json`` cannot represent both.

This module owns three things and nothing else:

1. resolving the *effective source* home from the same launch environment that
   resolved the ``kimi`` binary (never ``os.environ`` of the cao-server process —
   those can differ),
2. materialising a minimal, isolated runtime home from it, and
3. merging the CAO profile's MCP servers into that home's ``mcp.json``.

It deliberately does **not** copy the source home wholesale. Only items that
carry *semantics* are brought across; runtime-generated state stays behind so N
workers cannot corrupt each other's sessions, logs, or updates. The allowlist is
a list, not a denylist: a future Kimi release that invents a new runtime-state
directory cannot silently leak it into every worker's home.

**Workspace trust (A4).** ``workspace-trust/`` is the one directory that is
neither ordinary runtime state nor ordinary user semantics. It records
*decisions the operator already made in normal Kimi*, and Kimi consults it to
decide whether to raise its workspace-trust dialog at all. Discarding it meant
every CAO worker re-asked a question the operator had already answered, which
left the server-wide ``CAO_KIMI_CODE_TRUST_WORKSPACE`` override as the only
unattended path — far coarser than "this one repository is trusted".

It is therefore **snapshot-copied**, not shared and not symlinked: the worker
inherits the operator's existing decisions, and any record Kimi writes during
the worker's life lands only in the disposable runtime home. The copy is
treated as opaque, security-sensitive Kimi state — CAO never parses or
regenerates the record schema, never follows a symlinked trust store, and never
retains an internal symlink that could reach back out of the snapshot. See
:meth:`KimiCodeRuntimeHomeBuilder._snapshot_workspace_trust`.

Preserving an existing decision is not the same as making a new one: a folder
the operator has *not* trusted still produces a dialog, and the provider still
fails closed without the explicit opt-in.

#: right call for ``skills/``, where a user may legitimately link a shared
#: skills directory, but the wrong one here: a symlink inside a trust snapshot
#: is a path back out of the snapshot, into state the worker does not own. Trust
#: state gets its own fail-closed copy routine instead.
#:
#: The record schema is undocumented and Kimi-owned. It is copied as opaque
#: bytes; CAO must never parse it, key it, or regenerate it. Only Kimi decides
#: what "trusted" means.
TRUST_DIR_NAME = "workspace-trust"

#: Defensive bound on the trust snapshot. Kimi's store is a flat set of small
#: record files, so this is far above any legitimate size; it exists so a
#: pathological or hostile source tree cannot turn the snapshot into an
#: unbounded walk.
#:
#: **A4.1 — the bound counts every traversal entry, not just copied records.**
#: It previously counted only the regular files it had copied, so a tree of
#: empty directories was walked and materialised without limit: 4160 empty
#: directories produced 4160 runtime directories, zero records and zero skips,
#: and the "cannot be unbounded" claim was simply false. Directories, regular
#: files, symlink entries and every other filesystem entry each consume one unit
#: of this budget.
#:
#: **P3 — the bound covers enumeration too.** The traversal previously read each
#: source directory in full (``sorted(scan)``) and only then applied the budget,
#: so a single 10,000-entry directory was fully enumerated and allocated even
#: though only 4,096 records were copied. Only a budget-sized prefix of a
#: directory is read now, so the one bound limits directory enumeration,
#: allocation, copying and recursive descent together.
#:
#: Reaching the limit truncates rather than fails: traversal is pruned, no
#: further entry is copied, the disposition is recorded
#: (``RuntimeHomeResult.trust_truncated``) and a warning is emitted. The launch
#: must never be aborted by a pathological store.
MAX_TRUST_ENTRIES = 4096

#: Directories that are *referenced* rather than copied. ``bin/`` holds Kimi's
#: self-managed 175 MB binary; it is neither credential-bearing nor a state
#: store, and every CAO-managed Kimi process runs with auto-update disabled, so
#: no worker writes through the link. Copying it once per worker would cost
#: ~175 MB each for no isolation benefit. Tested explicitly (see the module
#: tests): the link is created, the source is never written, and a source home
#: without ``bin/`` builds fine.
#:
#: **Known, accepted risk (A3-7).** These entries stay links, so they are the
#: one place where the runtime home can still *reach back* into the real home.
#: Two consequences are accepted rather than fixed, and are recorded here so the
#: trade-off is a decision and not an oversight:
#:
#: * a Kimi process that ignores ``KIMI_CODE_NO_AUTO_UPDATE`` could write
#:   through the link into the shared 175 MB binary;
#: * when ``bin/`` is itself a symlink, ``Path.is_dir()`` follows it and the
#:   runtime home gets a link-to-a-link. Resolution still lands on the real
#:   directory (one extra hop), so behaviour is unchanged — but the runtime
#:   home's ``bin`` is not a stable path, and a caller that inspects
#:   ``os.readlink`` sees the intermediate link rather than the final target.

#: Runtime-generated state that must stay isolated. Listed for documentation and

#: at these at all because the copy set is an allowlist.
#:
#: ``workspace-trust`` is deliberately **absent** from this list as of A4: it is
#: a snapshot-copied security input rather than per-worker runtime state. See
#: :data:`TRUST_DIR_NAME`. Every other entry here remains unconditionally
#: forbidden — sharing ``sessions`` would let two workers collide in one

        unattended answer was the server-wide opt-in. Copying the store forward
        lets Kimi answer the question itself: an already-trusted folder produces
        no dialog, and an untrusted one still produces one.

        The three dispositions, all fail-closed:

        ``_copy_tree`` cannot be reused here: it passes ``symlinks=True``, which
        is correct for ``skills/`` (a user may link a shared directory) but
        wrong for a trust snapshot, where a retained link is a path back out of
        the snapshot into state the worker does not own. Internal symlinks —
        file or directory — are therefore skipped outright with a warning
        rather than materialised, which is the conservative reading of "prove
        the result stays bounded and immutable".

        **The budget counts every traversal entry, not just copied records**
        (A4.1). Counting only regular files left the bound trivially bypassable:
        a tree of empty directories was walked and materialised without limit.
        Directories, regular files, symlink entries and every other filesystem
        entry each consume one unit of :data:`MAX_TRUST_ENTRIES`.

        **The budget also governs enumeration** (P3). ``sorted(scan)`` read a
        directory *in full* before the budget applied, so a single directory of
        10,000 entries consumed all 10,000 scandir entries and allocated 10,000
        ``DirEntry`` objects while copying only 4,096. Only a budget-sized prefix
        is now read, so enumeration, allocation, copying and recursive descent
        are bounded together. Global sort order is deliberately **not**
        preserved: it is exactly what defeated the bound. Within the bounded
        prefix entries are still sorted per directory, so a store under budget
        is processed in the same deterministic order as before.

        Only ordinary regular files are copied. Everything else — FIFO, socket,
        block device, character device, symlink, unreadable entry — is skipped
        with a warning and recorded, so a non-regular entry degrades one entry
        instead of aborting the launch.

        Exhausting the budget truncates: traversal is pruned, no further entry
        is copied, and ``truncated=True`` is returned. The snapshot is then a
        partial prefix of the source store, which is the intended degradation —
        the worker inherits fewer records, never a broken launch.

        The destination is never descended into through a link: directories are
        created by the copy itself, at 0700, and records are written as real
        files at 0600. The source is only ever read.

        Residual, accepted race: the kind is read with ``lstat`` and the copy
        then re-opens by path, so a source entry that *becomes* a symlink
        between the two would be read through. That requires write access to the
        operator's own trust store, and the worst case is reading a file into the
        disposable home — never a write back into the source. Left unguarded
        deliberately: hardening it would mean hand-rolling the copy with
        ``O_NOFOLLOW``, which is more machinery than this failure mode warrants.

        directory into their home, so links are reproduced verbatim
        (``symlinks=True``) and never walked through.

        Verbatim reproduction is only correct for links that keep their meaning

        stays inside the tree does too (the structure is preserved, so the same

        lies **outside** the tree does not: the text is reproduced but it now
        resolves under the disposable home, so the link dangles and a skill or
        plugin the operator linked in silently disappears for workers —

        materialises ordinary regular files as real 0600 files and *skips* every
        symlink instead of reproducing it. That is the same conservative policy
