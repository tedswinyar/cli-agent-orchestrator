"""Official xAI Grok Build CLI provider implementation.

Observed with ``grok 1.0.0 (3cd0d0cbce) [stable]`` in ``--no-alt-screen``
mode.  The empty composer remains visible while a turn is running, so status
detection gives the live ``Waiting for response…`` / ``[stop]`` /
``Esc:cancel`` markers priority.  Completed turns end at ``Worked for <time>``.
Grok reads MCP servers from ``$GROK_HOME/config.toml`` and exits with
``/quit``.  Tool approval pickers expose a ``N/M:select`` footer.

Each CAO terminal receives a private ``GROK_HOME``.  Its MCP configuration is
written directly and atomically (never through ``grok mcp add``, which rewrites
the file as mode 0664), and authentication is reused through a narrow symlink
to the user's existing ``~/.grok/auth.json`` rather than copying credentials.

        """Return configured MCP server names safely referenced by ``allowedTools``.

        Grok's ``MCPTool(server__*)`` permission language accepts a pattern.
        Never interpolate an arbitrary ``@...`` CAO entry into that pattern:
        a CAO entry is expanded against the server names actually configured for
        this profile (plus CAO's built-in orchestration server) by the shared
        ``tool_mapping.granted_mcp_servers`` rule, and only a resulting CONCRETE
        name that is also a conventional server identifier may grant MCP access.
        So ``@plugin-*`` — which ``docs/agent-plugins.md`` documents and which
        this site used to deny by requiring an exact literal — grants
        ``MCPTool(plugin-tools__*)`` when that server is configured and nothing at
        all when it is not. The pattern itself never reaches Grok's permission
        language, and ``@builtin`` is CAO vocabulary rather than an MCP server
        reference. Unknown or malformed entries remain denied by the enclosing
        dontAsk policy instead of widening it.

        The matching rule is shared with OpenCode's ``agent.<id>.tools`` grant in
        ``services/install_service.py`` on purpose: two hand-written matchers are
        how the documented glob came to work on neither.
