"""Kimi CLI provider implementation.

Kimi CLI (https://kimi.com/code) is Moonshot AI's coding agent CLI tool.
It runs as an interactive TUI using prompt_toolkit in the terminal.

Key characteristics:
- Command: ``kimi`` (installed via ``brew install kimi-cli`` or ``uv tool install kimi-cli``)
- Idle prompt: ``💫`` (thinking mode, default) or ``✨`` (optionally prefixed with ``username@dirname``)
- Processing: No idle prompt visible at bottom while the response is streaming
- Response format: Bullet points prefixed with ``•`` (U+2022)
- Thinking output: Gray italic ``•`` bullets (ANSI color 38;5;244 + italic)
- User input: Displayed in a bordered box using box-drawing characters (╭│╰)
- Auto-approve: ``--yolo`` flag bypasses all tool action confirmations
- Agent profiles: ``--agent-file FILE`` (YAML format, extends built-in 'default' agent)
- MCP config: ``--mcp-config TEXT`` (JSON configuration, repeatable flag)
- Exit commands: ``/exit``, ``exit``, ``quit``, or Ctrl-D
- Status bar: ``HH:MM [yolo] agent (model, thinking) ctrl-x: toggle mode context: X.X%``

Status Detection Strategy:
    Kimi CLI uses a full-screen TUI (prompt_toolkit), so status is detected by
    checking the bottom of tmux capture output:
    - IDLE: Prompt pattern (username@dir💫/✨) visible at bottom, no user input yet
    - PROCESSING: No prompt at bottom (response is streaming)
    - COMPLETED: Prompt at bottom + response content after last user input
    - ERROR: Error message patterns or empty output

Two dialects, one provider id
-----------------------------
The public provider identifier stays ``kimi_cli`` for backward compatibility,
but the CLI it drives has forked into two incompatible TUIs:

``KimiDialect.LEGACY`` — MoonshotAI ``kimi-cli``. Emoji prompt, YAML agent file,
``--mcp-config`` JSON injection, ``--yolo`` meaning "never ask", ``•`` U+2022
bullets, a per-directory single-instance lock worked around with a temp cwd.

``KimiDialect.CODE`` — Kimi Code (``agent-core-v2``). No emoji prompt, boxed
composer, Markdown agent file with ``${base_prompt}``, **no MCP CLI flag at
all**, ``--auto`` meaning "never ask" (``--yolo`` was redefined to "ask when
needed"), ``●`` U+25CF bullets, a braille working indicator, and no per-directory
lock — so the temp cwd is both unnecessary and actively harmful.

The dialect is resolved from the *capabilities* of the resolved binary, never
from a version string (see ``KimiDialect`` / ``_probe_dialect``), and an
unrecognised or self-contradictory capability signature fails closed rather than
silently taking the legacy path.

Row-level semantics for both dialects live in
:mod:`cli_agent_orchestrator.providers.kimi_transcript`; per-worker
``KIMI_CODE_HOME`` construction lives in
:mod:`cli_agent_orchestrator.providers.kimi_runtime_home`. That home is built at
a managed path derived from the terminal id
(``CAO_HOME_DIR/providers/kimi_code/<sha256(terminal_id)>/kimi-home``) rather
than in a random scratch directory, so a terminal deleted after a cao-server
restart can still have its copied credentials removed — see the managed-location
section on :class:`KimiCliProvider`.

        Kimi Code raises this dialog for **any** untrusted cwd, even when the
        repository declares no project MCP servers, and its default selection is
        *Trust this folder*. Blindly sending Enter therefore silently grants
        project-MCP trust to whatever folder the terminal launched in — which is
        precisely why this handler is positive-identification only:

        * the exact dialog must be present (title + navigation hint + a
          recognised option set), and
        * the workspace the dialog names must equal the pane's actual working
          directory, and
        * the selection must be readable.

        If the selection is already *Trust this folder* it is accepted. Otherwise
        CAO navigates deterministically, re-reads the pane, and only then accepts.
        Every other outcome — unknown layout, unreadable selection, mismatched
        workspace — fails closed without sending a key.

        A3-5: answering at all additionally requires the operator's explicit
        opt-in (:func:`kimi_trust_opt_in`). This method never grants project
        trust on its own initiative — see the module-level note on
        :data:`KIMI_TRUST_OPT_IN_ENV` for the evidence behind that.

        A4: this handler is only reached for a folder the operator has *not*
        already trusted. A worker's runtime home inherits the trust records from
        the real ``KIMI_CODE_HOME`` (see
        :class:`~cli_agent_orchestrator.providers.kimi_runtime_home.KimiCodeRuntimeHomeBuilder`),
        so a folder already trusted in normal Kimi produces no dialog here at
        all. That is what makes pre-trusting one repository — rather than
        setting the server-wide opt-in — a real answer to this error.

        Returns True when the dialog was handled (so the caller can reset its
        idle timer), False when no trust dialog is on screen. Raises
        :class:`ProviderError` when a dialog is present but must not be answered.

        to tool_call_timeout_ms=60000 (60s) for MCP tool calls, which is too short
        for handoff operations. We modify the config file directly instead of using
        ``--config`` CLI flag, because ``--config`` causes Kimi CLI to bypass the
        default config file and breaks OAuth authentication.

        The timeout is NOT restored on cleanup because:
        1. Multiple Kimi instances may share the config file concurrently

        """Dismiss kimi's startup dialogs if they appear.

        Two dialog classes are handled here:

        1. The upgrade-reminder dialog (both dialects): polls the pane for the
           interactive "[s] Skip reminders for version X" menu and answers 's' so
           kimi can proceed to its ready prompt.
        2. The Kimi Code workspace-trust dialog (``KimiDialect.CODE`` only),
           delegated to :meth:`_handle_trust_dialog`, which positively
           identifies the dialog and the folder before sending any key.

        Mirrors ClaudeCodeProvider._handle_startup_prompts (once PR #451 lands):
        exits early if kimi is already ready (no dialog → no delay).

        issue #494: this is a real coroutine, not sync code called from an
        async caller. This method is awaited directly from initialize(), which
        runs on cao-server's single asyncio event loop. Every tmux-backed call
        here (``get_history``/``send_keys``) is a blocking subprocess exec, and
        a plain ``time.sleep`` would block the WHOLE OS thread -- freezing every
        other in-flight request -- for as long as this loop runs. All blocking
        calls are offloaded to a worker thread via ``asyncio.to_thread`` and all
        sleeps are ``asyncio.sleep``, so this coroutine yields the event loop
        instead of freezing it (see PR #451 for the ClaudeCodeProvider fix this
        mirrors, and issue #494 for why this method and its Antigravity/Copilot
        counterparts needed the same fix).

        Idle-gap semantics (see issue #400): a cold or containerized start can
        render the dialog LATE, past the old fixed ~20s window. Rather than a
        total-window budget, ``idle_gap`` is the maximum quiet stretch tolerated
        with no new prompt: answering the dialog resets the idle timer, and the
        loop exits once no prompt appears for ``idle_gap`` seconds (or kimi is
        ready). Total runtime is hard-capped by ``outer_timeout``.

        The idle-gap exit only starts counting once the first dialog has been
        handled -- until then, a first dialog arriving later than ``idle_gap``
        (the scenario issue #400 itself reports) would otherwise be missed: the
        loop would exit at the idle-gap boundary having never seen it. Before
        any dialog is observed, only ``outer_timeout`` can end the loop.

        Args:
            idle_gap: Seconds of no-new-prompt quiet that ends the loop. Defaults
                to the ``startup_prompt_handler_timeout`` setting.
            outer_timeout: Hard cap (seconds) on total handler runtime. Defaults
                to the ``provider_init_timeout`` setting; initialize() passes the
                per-profile-resolved value so a containerized profile's longer
                init budget also governs this handler (mirrors ClaudeCodeProvider).

        Returns ``True`` only when nothing CAO-managed remains on disk for this

        The managed-home removal is **not** gated on the dialect. Kimi Code
        copies the operator's credentials, MCP configuration and Kimi state into
        a deterministic managed directory, and that is exactly why the path is
        derived from the terminal id: the provider object is rebuilt from
        terminal metadata after a cao-server restart, where ``_temp_dir`` is
        ``None`` and nothing in memory names the directory. Two concrete
        lifecycle reasons mean the directory can exist while the dialect is
        unknown or legacy — ``initialize()`` materialises the home before the
        service persists ``provider_variant`` (a crash in that window leaves a
        credential-bearing home on a NULL-variant row), and a terminal
        re-launched under the other dialect keeps the home its earlier CODE
        launch created. Attempting the removal unconditionally is not a dialect
        guess: no behaviour is inferred from it, the target is this terminal's
        own validated path, and the call is a no-op returning ``True`` when no
        such home exists.

        Scratch includes legacy MCP credentials in kimi-launch.sh, so its
        removal is also mandatory and recoverable from terminal identity.
        MCP timeout is not restored because multiple instances share it.
