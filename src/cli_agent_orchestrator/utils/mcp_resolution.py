"""Resolution of the bundled cao-mcp-server command for agent MCP configs.

Bundled agent profiles declare the orchestration MCP server as the bare console
script ``cao-mcp-server``. That only resolves if the script's directory is on
the *agent subprocess's* ``PATH`` — which is not guaranteed across install
methods (an unactivated venv, a devcontainer, a ``pip install --prefix`` to a
non-standard location). When it fails to resolve, the agent starts without its
orchestration tools (handoff / assign / send_message) and silently no-ops.

``resolve_cao_mcp_command`` rewrites the bare command to a PATH-independent
invocation, mirroring the three-tier fallback the Copilot provider already used
inline:

    1. the ``cao-mcp-server`` script sitting next to the running interpreter
       (the same environment that launched cao-server — the common case for
       ``uv tool install`` / ``pipx``), then
    2. ``cao-mcp-server`` as resolved on ``PATH``, then
    3. ``<python> -m cli_agent_orchestrator.mcp_server.server`` — always
       runnable because it does not depend on a console script being on PATH.

Any command other than the bare ``cao-mcp-server`` (e.g. a user's custom MCP
server, or an explicit absolute path) passes through unchanged.

    Any command other than the bundled ``cao-mcp-server`` passes through
    unchanged. For the bundled command, the resolution order depends on whether
    the result is written to disk:

    - ``persisted=False`` (default, runtime providers that rebuild the launch
      config every time): prefer the script next to the running interpreter —
      an exact, hijack-proof match recomputed each launch.
    - ``persisted=True`` (the resolved command is written to a config file the
      provider reads later, e.g. Kiro/Q agent JSON): prefer the script as
      resolved on ``PATH``. Tool installers (uv, pipx) keep a *stable* launcher
      there (e.g. ``~/.local/bin/cao-mcp-server``) that survives upgrades,
      whereas the interpreter-sibling path lives under a versioned venv dir that
      ``uv tool upgrade`` relocates — which would leave a persisted path stale.

    Both orders fall back to the module entrypoint (``<python> -m
    cli_agent_orchestrator.mcp_server.server``), which needs no console script
    on PATH.

    Args:
        command: The ``command`` field from an MCP server config.
        args: The ``args`` field (may be empty).
        persisted: Whether the resolved command will be written to disk and
            reused across CAO upgrades (see above).

    Seven of CAO's providers write MCP configuration in a format with **no

    2026-09-16). The Agent Plugins mapper always supplies an absolute, contained
    ``cwd`` -- defaulting to the plugin root -- so a plugin whose ``command`` or

    provider's session directory. Reported by review 5222539218 on #584 (item 4).
