"""HTTP calls from the ``cao`` CLI process to its own cao-server, with the bearer attached.

The CLI commands (``launch``, ``session``, ``terminal``, ``workflow``, ``info``,
``shutdown``) reach the API over loopback HTTP. When the auth layer is on (an
IdP, or a standalone ``CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN``), every scope-gated route wants
``Authorization: Bearer <token>``; the MCP servers and the orchestration
helpers already forward ``CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN`` for their internal hop, but
the CLI sent nothing and got a bare ``401`` (#807). This module is the one
place the CLI's ``get``/``post``/``delete`` go through -- the command modules
and the polling helpers in ``utils.terminal`` alike -- so the header is
attached once, and only for URLs that name this node. It lives in ``utils``
rather than ``cli`` because ``utils.terminal`` needs it and must not import
the CLI package.

Same surface as the parts of ``requests`` the commands use, so a command
module can ``from cli_agent_orchestrator.utils import api_http`` and call
``api_http.get(...)`` exactly as it called ``requests.get(...)``; tests patch
``cli.commands.<module>.api_http.<verb>`` and see the call unchanged, because
the header is added inside the verb, not at the call site.

Default-off: with no token in the CLI's environment no header is attached
and the request is byte-for-byte what it was. Whether the SERVER wants a
bearer is not something this process can see in its own environment (the
server's auth mode lives in the server's), so the signal is the response: a
``401`` from this node's API on a request that carried no bearer becomes
:class:`AuthNotConfiguredError`, a ``RequestException`` the commands' existing
error handling prints, carrying the actionable message instead of the bare
status. A ``401`` on a request that DID carry a token is the caller's to
handle (wrong token, wrong scopes, expired).
