    # CAO Operations MCP Server

    Manage CLI Agent Orchestrator profiles and sessions from outside a CAO session.
    Requires the CAO API server running at localhost:9889.

    ## Typical Workflow
    1. list_profiles to inspect available profiles
    2. get_profile_details to review a profile's full prompt and metadata
    3. install_profile to install a profile for a target provider
    4. launch_session to start a new CAO session, optionally with its first task
    5. send_session_message to deliver later prompts to a running terminal
    6. get_terminal_status to poll a worker until it finishes a task
    7. get_terminal_output to read a worker's result (or review its files/git diff)
    8. read_session_output to read a terminal's captured output by session name
    9. get_session_info or list_sessions to monitor overall progress
    10. shutdown_session to clean up when done

    The read-only GET that remains is a safety check on that single canonical

      cleanup (``dismantle_terminal_runtime`` returning False keeps the row,
      answers 409 and reports the session in ``errors``) the backend session is
      gone -- so ``get_session``, which requires it, 404s -- while the retained
