    """Write this agent's MCP servers into the shared ``opencode.json`` safely.

    OpenCode keeps every provider's MCP declarations in one shared file that CAO
    edits in place, which creates two obligations Kiro's/Copilot's wholesale
    rewrites do not have (design.md §10a):

    * **Never clobber a user's entry (Finding 2).** A plugin-derived server whose
      name already exists under an entry CAO cannot prove it owns is dropped with
      a report, not overwritten — and the agent is not granted a tool alias for a
      server CAO did not write.
    * **Disable, don't orphan, a withdrawn server (Finding 1).** Removal deletes a
      plugin's ``PLUGIN_ROOT`` but there is no ``opencode.json`` delete, so a
      server no longer in the desired set is set ``enabled: false`` — only when it
      is provably CAO's (its command resolves inside the plugin store), so a
      user's own server and CAO's ``cao-mcp-server`` are never touched.

    The same "only touch what CAO can prove it owns" rule governs the per-agent
    grant: ``upsert_agent_tools``/``remove_agent_tools`` merge into
    ``agent.<id>.tools`` and withdraw only the keys recorded in the
    ``cao-grants.json`` sidecar or provably naming a plugin-store server, so a
    user's ``model``, ``prompt`` or ``"bash": false`` on a CAO-installed agent
    survives every install and uninstall (review 3 on #584).

    ``allowed_tools`` is what keeps the no-auto-grant rule (issue #573 AC7)
    provider-independent. ``agent.<id>.tools`` **is** OpenCode's ``@<server>``
    grant, so writing ``{"<plugin-server>*": True}`` for a profile that never
    named it would reinstate on OpenCode exactly the widening the resolved
    allowlist withholds on every other provider. Delivery is unaffected: the
    server is still written into the shared ``mcp`` section, it is simply not
    switched on for an agent that was not granted it. Membership follows
    ``tool_mapping.granted_mcp_servers`` — ``"*"``, an explicit ``@<name>``, or a
    matching glob, which is what ``docs/agent-plugins.md`` documents — and it is
    the ONE rule Grok's launch path uses too, rather than a second matcher free
    to drift from it. The expansion is over the names actually written here, so a
    pattern can only ever select from what was delivered, and a human still had
    to write that pattern into the profile.

    Ownership is a heuristic without persisted provenance; see
    ``opencode_config.is_cao_owned_mcp_entry`` and design.md §10a options 1/2 for
    the exact-cleanup follow-up. Keeping the top-level ``tools`` default-deny
    matches the prior in-place behaviour.

    """Install an agent profile for the requested provider.

    ``provider`` resolution follows the same precedence as launch/handoff
    (see ``resolve_provider``): an explicit argument wins, then the profile's
    frontmatter ``provider:`` key, then ``DEFAULT_PROVIDER``. Pass ``None``
    to defer to the profile.

    ``preserve_recorded_provider`` materialises the provider's config WITHOUT
    re-recording the store copy's ``provider:`` key. It exists for exactly one
    caller — ``refresh_installed_agents_for_plugin_mcp``, which replays this
    function once per already-installed artifact — and defaults to False so
    every deliberate call keeps today's behaviour. The distinction is
    provenance versus configuration: recording a provider answers "which
    provider did the operator install this agent for", and only an operator's
    own ``cao install <agent> --provider X`` may answer it. A plugin add or
    remove re-materialises config for whatever is already installed and has no
    standing to change that answer; without this flag an agent installed for
    two providers ends up recorded as whichever leg the refresh loop visited
    last (spec ``pr584-review-fable`` R9, design §3.1).

    ``source`` must be either an https:// URL on the allowlist or a bare
    profile name matching ``_PROFILE_NAME_RE``. Local ``.md`` file paths
    are deliberately NOT accepted here — the CLI copies user files into
    the local store itself and then calls this function with the resulting
    bare stem. This split is what lets the HTTP/MCP surface share this
    function safely: every caller reaches the same two sanitised shapes,
    and no call site constructs ``Path(user_input)`` through this module.

    """Re-materialize provider configs so plugin MCP servers appear and disappear.

    Skill delivery needs no equivalent: skills are *projected* into ``SKILLS_DIR``
    and every provider reads that store (or a catalog rebuilt from it) at launch,
    so installing a plugin makes its skills reachable without rewriting a single
    provider file. MCP is the opposite — ``mcpServers`` is **baked into each
    provider's config at install time**: Kiro's agent JSON carries it inline, and
    OpenCode's shared ``opencode.json`` carries it plus a per-agent tool grant.
    Nothing re-reads a plugin's ``mcp.json`` later. So without this, a plugin's
    servers would only reach agents installed *after* the plugin, and uninstalling
    a plugin would leave its servers configured in every provider file that
    already had them — pointing at a ``PLUGIN_ROOT`` that no longer exists.

    The mechanism is deliberately "re-run the real thing" rather than a targeted
    patch of each provider file. Editing configs in place would mean a second
    implementation of every provider's MCP shape, which would drift from
    ``install_agent`` and is exactly the per-provider duplication the mapping
    design exists to avoid. ``install_agent`` is idempotent for a bare profile
    name — it reads the profile from the local store, downloads nothing, and
    mutates no environment when no ``env_vars`` are passed — so replaying it
    reproduces the current profile plus the current plugin set.

    Best effort by contract: this is called from the plugin install and uninstall
    paths, and a profile that has since been deleted, or a provider config that
    cannot be written, must not fail the plugin operation. Failures are logged and
    skipped.

    Returns:
        The names of the agents whose provider config was re-materialized, in the
        order attempted. Useful to tests and to callers that want to report how
