"""Turn a user-supplied plugin source into a staging directory — and nothing else.

Two source kinds, both deliberately thin (decision D2). There is **no** name
resolution against an index, no version solving, no dependency graph, no
signature check, and no update-checking service. The manifest's ``version`` is
recorded for display and staleness comparison only, which is the one use §10.2
sanctions.

Staging is not an implementation detail: it is what makes validation meaningful.
A local source is **copied** rather than referenced in place, so the bytes that
get validated are the bytes that get published, and a plugin directory the
operator keeps editing cannot change under a running session.
