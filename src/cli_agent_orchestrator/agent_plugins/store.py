``.state/`` is a **dot-prefixed sibling** so it is never mistaken for a plugin:
:meth:`InstalledPluginStore.list_installed` skips every name beginning with
``.``. That also makes crash-time staging directories (which are dot-prefixed
for the same reason) invisible to listing rather than half-installed plugins.

``PLUGIN_DATA`` lives **outside** ``AGENT_PLUGINS_DIR`` on purpose: §9.1 requires
its contents survive a plugin update, and an update replaces the plugin root
wholesale.

        record rebuilt from that stale snapshot with no lock and no freshness

        rebuild: materialization is slow filesystem work, and a rebuild that held
        the lock would serialize every install behind it.

    A SECOND lock file, deliberately not ``_store_lock``'s. The two serialize
    different spans and cannot be merged:

    * ``_store_lock`` guards one whole-store write and is **non-reentrant** --
      ``_write_back`` takes it. A lifecycle operation *contains* several such
      writes, so holding the store lock across the operation would deadlock on
      its own writeback. This is why "hold the existing store lock across the
      rebuild", which the reviewer explicitly anticipated, is not sufficient.
    * The lifecycle lock spans snapshot -> publish -> rebuild, which is the
      window review 5222539218 item 1 describes: an uninstall snapshots the
      installed set, a same-name reinstall commits, and the uninstall's sweep
      then deletes the newer projection. No ownership check can detect that,
      because ownership is not what went wrong -- the snapshot's *currency* is.

    LOCK ORDER IS LIFECYCLE -> STORE, NEVER THE REVERSE. Nothing executed while
    holding ``_store_lock`` may take this lock. Both are ``flock`` on their own
    descriptor, so the order is the only thing preventing a deadlock.

    ``timeout`` is polled rather than blocking indefinitely: an operator who runs
    two installs deserves a clear "retry" over a hang. ``blocking=False`` is the
    read path (``sweep_dangling_projections``), which must never wait behind a
    write.

    Where ``fcntl`` is unavailable this degrades to a no-op, exactly as
    ``_store_lock`` does; the swap-time ``force`` re-check inside ``publish``
    remains the last-resort guarantee there.
