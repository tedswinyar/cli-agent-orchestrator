"""The total validator for candidate Agent Plugin directories.

:func:`validate_plugin` answers, for **any** directory, whether it is a loadable
Agent Plugin and what components it contains — and it never raises. The CLI, the
HTTP API, the web panel, the installer, and CI all need the same structured
answer, and three of those five must render *partial* success, so a total
function returning a report is the only shape that serves all five. This is
correctness property P1.

Schema handling is offline by construction (§5.2 forbids retrieving a schema
while loading a plugin): the schemas are read from bytes committed under
``schemas/agent_plugins/1.0.0/`` via ``importlib.resources``, and the
``referencing`` registry handed to ``jsonschema`` **refuses every retrieval**, so
an unexpected ``$ref`` raises instead of quietly becoming a network call.

MCP components
--------------
``mcp.json`` is detected here and mapped by delegation: :func:`_map_mcp` calls
``mcp_mapping.load_and_map``, so the report carries ``mcp_present`` and the mapped
servers. This module owns no expansion or schema logic for MCP itself — the
placeholder rules, the transport matrix, and the ``mcp.schema.json`` validation
all live in ``mcp_mapping``, and delivery into agent profiles lives in
``mcp_delivery``. Keeping all three separate is what lets this module stay a
*total function over a directory* with no notion of where the result goes.

(Increment 1 stopped at detection: it recorded ``mcp_present=True`` with an "MCP
not supported in this CAO version" finding and read nothing, which is what §11.3
rule 1 and §7.2.2 rule 4 prescribe for an unsupported component type. Increment 2
replaced that finding with real mapping. Whichever increment, **an unusable
``mcp.json`` never affects the plugin's skills** — §7.2.2.2, §10.1.)

    The top-level checks in ``_discover_skills`` only look at ``skills/<name>``
    and its ``SKILL.md``. Copy mode then runs ``copytree`` over the whole subtree,
    so a nested link is *dereferenced* at projection time -- long after
    validation said the skill was fine. This closes that gap by walking the tree
    the copy will walk, before anything is copied.

    Why one ``os.walk`` is not enough
    ---------------------------------
    ``os.walk(..., followlinks=False)`` inspects a directory symlink and then
    never looks *inside* it, so a single walk validated the link and nothing
    under it. ``skills/inspection/assets -> ../../shared`` is contained and
    therefore permitted, but ``shared/evil -> /etc/passwd`` sits in a subtree no
    walk ever entered -- and ``copytree(..., symlinks=False)`` dereferences the
    whole chain, so the external bytes reached the live skill store with zero
    findings. Each permitted directory symlink's target is therefore validated as
    its own tree, before anything can dereference its descendants.

    Deliberately applied to NESTED entries only. ``os.walk`` always descends the
    directory it is given, even with ``followlinks=False``, and §4.1 explicitly
    permits ``skills/<name>`` to itself be a symlink whose target resolves inside
    the root (``test_skill_symlink_inside_the_root_is_permitted``). Rejecting the
    walk root would break that permitted shape.

    Termination is a requirement, not a hope. Iterative with an explicit worklist
    rather than recursive, so a package nesting contained directory symlinks
    thousands deep answers with a finding instead of ``RecursionError``; a loop is
    caught by the open-route set carried in each :data:`_PendingTree`; and
    ``validated`` bounds the total work when several links reach the same
    directory (a diamond, which is emphatically *not* a loop).

    Returns the FIRST problem rather than a list: the skill is skipped either way,
    and one clear reason is more actionable than an inventory of a tree the
    operator cannot see.
