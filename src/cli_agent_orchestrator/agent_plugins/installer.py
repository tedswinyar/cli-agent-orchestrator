"""Sequence resolve → validate → publish → project, so failure changes nothing.

The ordering is load-bearing, not incidental:

1. Resolve into staging.
2. Validate **the staging copy**. Not loadable → return the report, publish
   nothing.
3. Refuse a name already in the installed set unless ``force`` (mirroring
   ``cli/commands/skills.py::_install_skill_folder``'s ``FileExistsError`` +
   ``--force`` semantics).
4. Publish atomically (stage → rename).
5. Rebuild the projection from the whole installed set.
6. Refresh baked provider artifacts through the **existing**
   ``utils/skill_injection.refresh_all_cao_managed_agents()``, exactly as
   ``cao skills add/remove`` already does. Skipping this would leave Copilot
   ``.agent.md`` catalogs stale — the one delivery path baked at install time
   rather than read at launch.

Steps 1–2 are what ``dry_run`` performs, and ``dry_run`` is what CI, the
author-side dogfooding, and ``cao plugin validate`` all use.

The install record is written as part of step 4 rather than after step 5, so a
published plugin root is never recorded-less; step 5 then updates the record's
``projected_skill_names`` in place. The observable contract — nothing published
unless loadable, everything consistent afterwards — is unchanged.
