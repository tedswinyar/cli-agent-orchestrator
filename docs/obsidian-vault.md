# Obsidian Vault

CAO can scan a configured Obsidian vault and maintain CAO-authored notes in
one managed folder. This guide covers the committed configuration,
maintenance commands, write safety, and current limits. It does not require
the Obsidian application to be running.

> This release supports one configured vault. Use
> [Configuration](configuration.md) for the complete `settings.json` reference.

## Configure a vault

Add a `memory.vault` object to `settings.json`. Replace every path and
identifier in this example with values for your own environment; the paths
below are placeholders.

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "vault": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_recall_body_chars": 4096,
      "vaults": [
        {
          "id": "knowledge-vault",
          "root": "/path/to/your-vault",
          "managed_folder": "_cao",
          "exclude": ["Private/**"],
          "max_note_bytes": 262144,
          "max_notes": 20000,
          "max_frontmatter_bytes": 16384,
          "mappings": [
            {
              "folder": "_cao",
              "scope": "global",
              "index": true,
              "writable": true,
              "secret_gate": "reject"
            },
            {
              "folder": "Projects/example-project",
              "scope": "project",
              "scope_id": "example-project",
              "index": true,
              "allow_hardlinks": false
            },
            {
              "folder": "Agents/example-agent",
              "scope": "agent",
              "scope_id": "example-agent",
              "index": true
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`root` must be an existing absolute vault directory. `id` uses lowercase
letters, digits, and hyphens. Mapping folders are vault-relative POSIX paths.
They may map one `global`, `project`, or `agent` scope; `project` and `agent`
mappings require `scope_id`, while `global` must not have one. A scope can be
mapped only once.

`managed_folder` is the CAO-owned folder within the vault. It must lie in
exactly one writable mapping, and that mapping is the only writable mapping.
Create the folder before enabling the configuration.

### Scan selection and bounds

`exclude` holds additional relative glob patterns. CAO also always excludes
`.obsidian/`, `.trash/`, `.git/`, and `_cao-*` paths. Exclusions prevent files
from becoming scan candidates; they do not grant CAO permission to write
elsewhere.

The validated bounds are:

| Setting | Default | Maximum |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `max_note_bytes` | 262144 | 1048576 |
| `max_notes` | 20000 | 100000 |
| `max_frontmatter_bytes` | 16384 | 65536 |
| `max_recall_body_chars` | 4096 | 65536 |

The first three belong to the vault entry. `max_recall_body_chars` belongs to
the enclosing `memory.vault` object. Its runtime recall behavior is documented
in [Recall and injection](#recall-and-injection).

`allow_hardlinks` defaults to `false` for each mapping. A hardlinked note is
otherwise refused during scanning. Set it to `true` only when that sharing is
intentional.

### Automatic injection

`inject: false` governs whether eligible indexed content is routed into
automatic agent context only. It is not a confidentiality control: the mapping
folder, `exclude`, and `index` setting define what CAO can currently read and
index, while explicit recall and anything that can read the vault or call the
local API remain separate access paths. An agent can therefore pull content
that CAO will not push into its automatic context.

Curator injection bounds apply to CAO-mediated vault reads for the
`memory_manager` identity. Agent-scoped mappings are returned only to a
requester positively identified as a non-curator; unknown identities, including
ordinary CLI recall without a terminal, are refused. These bounds cannot
constrain an agent that reads vault files directly or spawns another identity.
A vault mapping scoped to `agent` therefore returns nothing to plain CLI recall
without a resolvable terminal, where earlier releases returned its notes.

## Recall and injection

Vault recall uses one confined read path. Only notes currently indexed by a
successful reconciliation are eligible; quarantined, excluded, and unsupported
notes are not returned, even if older derived metadata remains. An indexed note
can still yield no result when CAO cannot safely open or decode its current
file. Run `cao memory vault reconcile --apply` after resolving a finding or
changing vault content.

A configured mapping remains the authoritative backend when `index: false`.
That mapping is deliberately inert: recall, injection, and managed writes are
all unavailable, and CAO never falls back to a retained native replica. The
accepted consequence is that an `index: false` mapped scope has no memory
content. `cao memory vault status` lists every inert mapping and its residual
projection-row count; the next applied reconciliation retracts those rows.

Recall returns this state in its `index_freshness` field as `fresh` or `stale`.
CAO compares the current file size and modification time with the values
recorded at reconciliation.
`stale` does not withhold a note: release one has no watcher or implicit
reconciliation, so CAO serves the safely readable current content and marks it
stale. Reconcile the vault to refresh its derived metadata and relationships.
Reconciliation alone does not release a note quarantined by the secret gate;
remove or change the matching content before reconciling again.

`max_recall_body_chars` defaults to 4096 characters. A longer note body is
clipped with a visible `[Content truncated for recall]` marker, and the recall
result records that it was truncated. This is deliberately lossy; inspect the
note in the vault when the complete body matters. It is separate from the
tighter context budget used for automatic injection. Explicit recall otherwise
returns readable source content verbatim; credential-shaped redaction applies
only to automatic provider-bound vault injection.

Automatic injection always applies the injection policy; a caller on that path
cannot waive it. Mappings with `inject: false` are omitted, as described above,
and the deterministic builder considers only session, project, and global
scopes, in that order. Each scope is limited independently to ten entries and
its share of the context character budget (at most 1000 characters); unused
space is not reassigned. Related entries are added only after their primary
entry and are capped at five across one context build. A recallable note can
therefore be absent from an agent prompt because its mapping is not injectable,
its scope is agent, or it lost a per-scope or related-entry budget decision.
Vault status reports injection budget effects without recording note content.
Before any vault-backed line is added to provider-bound automatic context, CAO
unconditionally replaces credential-shaped substrings with named redaction
markers. This also covers credentials added after the last reconciliation.
Explicit recall remains verbatim, and the source note is never rewritten.
Vault status exposes only content-free
`injection_redaction.memories_redacted` and
`injection_redaction.pattern_matches` counters.

When a same-session memory curator is available, CAO may use its returned
context block. Any curator failure, busy state, timeout, unavailable provider,
or unusable response falls back to the deterministic builder so injection does
not block the worker. That fallback can produce a different selection from the
curator; it does not bypass the injection policy.

### Secret handling

Each mapping has a `secret_gate`:

- `reject` is the default. A secret-bearing note is quarantined at index time
  and reported.
- `warn` indexes the note and still reports the secret finding.

Pattern matching is deliberately conservative. A note about credential
handling can legitimately match a credential-shaped pattern; `warn` is the
operator escape hatch for indexing and explicit recall in that case. CAO does
not alter the note, but automatic provider-bound vault injection always
redacts credential-shaped substrings, including on `warn` mappings configured
with `inject: true`. That configuration remains visible as a status warning.

For managed writes, the gate checks the authored body and CAO-generated
`cao` metadata before publishing. Preserved user frontmatter is not scanned or
rewritten by this gate; review and change that frontmatter directly when it
contains credential-shaped text.

`CAO_MEMORY_VAULT_ENABLED` can only disable a file-defined vault
configuration. Set it to a false value to turn the configured vault off for a
process. It cannot enable an absent or file-disabled vault, and no environment
variable configures a vault path, mapping, or scope.

## Maintenance commands

All vault operations are local CLI commands. There is no MCP tool for
rescanning or mutating a vault.

```text
cao memory vault status [--format table|json]
cao memory vault scan [--dry-run]
cao memory vault reconcile [--apply] [--format table|json]
cao memory vault rebuild --apply
cao memory vault migrate --scope {global|project|agent} [--scope-id ID] [--apply] [--delete-source] [--confirm-delete-source]
cao memory repair [--apply] [--receipt RECEIPT_ID]
```

`status` reports the derived vault projection and configuration warnings. Its
`process_local_unmapped_project_writes` field is explicitly process-local; a
fresh CLI process cannot present it as a durable count.
It also reports active and inconsistent migration-receipt counts. Receipt
warnings name only the receipt identity and a content-free reason code.

For each mapping with `index: false`, `status` also prints an `inert` line naming
recall, injection, and writes as off, plus the number of residual projection
rows awaiting reconciliation.

For the meaning and outcome of every finding code, see the canonical
[ADR-004 boundary table](issues/644-obsidian-vault-knowledge-source/adr-004-supported-markdown-boundary.md#the-boundary-table).
For example, `invalid_cao_block` means that a note contains invalid `cao`
metadata; the note is quarantined rather than coerced to a default.

`scan` is read-only. `--dry-run` is accepted for review workflows, but scanning
does not write files or derived rows with or without the flag.

`reconcile` plans the derived-state update by default. Pass `--apply` to write
that projection.

`rebuild` requires `--apply`. It deletes and re-derives vault-derived state;
vault access counts reset by design.

`migrate` copies one native memory scope into the managed folder and records a
durable receipt. The retained native copy becomes dormant, and only typed
relationships actually copied into `cao.links` are marked superseded. Migration
is a dry-run unless `--apply` is present. `--delete-source` retains its separate
destructive behavior and additionally requires both `--apply` and
`--confirm-delete-source`; without both flags, the command refuses before
migration.

The receipt binds the exact retained native snapshot to the managed note
identity. Its published hash is an immutable migration baseline used to prevent
a rerun from overwriting later canonical edits; normal CAO appends and human
edits do not rewrite that baseline or reactivate the native copy.

### Receipt-scoped rollback

Rollback is explicit and scoped to one receipt. It never deletes or rewrites
the canonical vault note. First preserve that note and retire its vault
authority, for example by moving it to an archive folder outside the mapping.
If the retained native copy must serve again after rollback, also change the
configuration so that the receipt's exact scope is no longer mapped: repoint or
remove the mapping for that scope, or disable the vault. Archiving or excluding
the note, or setting its mapping to `index: false`, does not release the scope
binding and therefore keeps the native copy hidden. Then run:

```text
cao memory vault reconcile --apply
cao memory repair --receipt RECEIPT_ID
cao memory repair --apply --receipt RECEIPT_ID
cao memory vault status
```

The first repair command is a dry-run. The apply command preflights the retained
native snapshot and every edge recorded by that receipt, then restores all
recorded prior statuses and marks the receipt rolled back in one transaction.
Any missing or drifted source or edge causes zero changes and an unresolved
exit; the receipt remains active. Repair without `--receipt` reports
content-free receipt inconsistencies but never restores an edge, and there is
no restore-all or `--undo` mode. Corpus repair may therefore report receipt
drift while exiting 0 when all native repairs resolve; a scoped `--receipt`
rollback that fails preflight remains unresolved and exits 1.

Rollback does not clear a forget/exclusion decision, enable an `index: false`
mapping, change configuration, or make an otherwise ineligible native memory
visible. Native recall resumes only when no current vault mapping resolves the
native identity's scope and no independent policy blocks it. A pre-migration
`proposal` edge returns to `proposal`, never to a blanket `active` state. The
archived note and all later human edits remain readable in Obsidian throughout.

A rolled-back receipt also prevents that same vault, scope, and key from being
silently migrated again. Both dry-run and apply report `receipt_not_active` and
leave the native copy, vault content, receipt, and relationships unchanged. To
place the content under vault management again, use a different identity
(key, scope, or vault), or explicitly forget the native copy with
`cao memory forget KEY --target native` once it is genuinely no longer needed and
then store the content to the vault normally. There is no force or receipt-reset
flag.

Migration reports lossy source fields by name when present:

- `access_count`
- `last_accessed_at`
- `last_compiled_at`
- `source_provider`
- `source_terminal_id`
- `related_keys`
- `append_only_section_history`

Typed native relationships are represented as `cao.links`. More than 64 typed
links cannot fit in the managed-note limit and are reported as the additional
lossy `cao.links` case rather than silently truncated.

## Write safety

CAO writes only notes under `managed_folder`. It never rewrites or deletes an
unmanaged vault note.

For a managed note, CAO preserves user frontmatter as text: it re-emits every
user-owned frontmatter byte unchanged except the top-level `cao` block it owns.
The writer may seed `tags` and `created` on a new managed note, but it does not
overwrite either key when the note already has a user value.

CAO stages its replacement inside the managed folder and publishes it
atomically on that filesystem. A non-empty managed note whose frontmatter
cannot be recognized is a conflict, not permission to rewrite it. Resolve the
note and run `cao memory vault reconcile --apply` before retrying.

Retention may remove CAO's native copy in a vault-backed scope, but it never
deletes the vault file. A vault-backed memory can therefore outlive the native
scope retention period until its vault note is changed or removed by its owner.

The release-one writer coordinates CAO writers, not Obsidian or a sync client.
"Obsidian open and writing" is not a guarantee in this release. Avoid a
simultaneous manual edit while a managed write is in progress, then reconcile
again if a conflict is reported.

## Known limitations

**Agent-scoped mappings are recall-only in this release.** They remain
available to explicit memory recall for the matching agent profile, but CAO's
deterministic injection builder considers only session, project, and global
scopes. Vault status reports this limitation for every agent-scoped mapping.
Adding agent scope to injection would change the existing per-scope budget
allocation, so it is intentionally deferred.

Graph projection has no requesting terminal identity. It therefore omits
agent-scoped vault notes and reports that the graph is partial in its metadata,
rather than publishing a topology that the same unknown requester cannot
recall.

CAO can retain identity across an unambiguous pure rename. A rename plus an
edit in one reconciliation window without an authored `cao.key` is reported,
not guessed. Add an authored `cao.key` when stable identity across those edits
matters.

`cao memory vault adopt` is deferred to release two. CAO does not turn an
existing unmanaged note into a managed note in this release.
