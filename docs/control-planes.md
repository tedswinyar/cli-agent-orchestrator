# Control Planes

CAO has four inbound management surfaces and one outbound extension surface.
The right choice depends on who initiates the action and which transport that
caller can use — and, for one of them, on whether the sessions being managed are
on this machine at all.

## Surfaces at a glance

| Surface | Direction | Caller | Transport | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Web UI](web-ui.md) | Inbound | Human operator | HTTP and WebSocket | Interactive browser management |
| `cao session` and the [session-management skill](../skills/cao-session-management/SKILL.md) | Inbound | Human, script, CI job, or shell-capable agent | Shell to HTTP | Portable automation and one-off commands |
| `cao-ops-mcp` | Inbound | External MCP-capable agent | MCP stdio to HTTP | Typed fleet-management tools |
| `cao fleet` and `cao worker` | Inbound | Human or script, from outside the cluster | Shell to HTTP, through a worker broker | Managing agents that run somewhere else |
| [Event Plugins](plugins.md) | Outbound | `cao-server` | Python hooks to an external destination | Notifications, audit records, and observability |

These surfaces manage CAO from outside a session. The separate
`cao-mcp-server` is an orthogonal, in-session surface through which CAO agents
coordinate with tools such as `handoff`, `assign`, and `send_message`. See the
[core MCP tools](../skills/cao-supervisor-protocols/SKILL.md#core-mcp-tools)
and the guide to
[choosing between assign and handoff](../skills/cao-supervisor-protocols/SKILL.md#choosing-between-assign-and-handoff).

## Inbound and outbound traffic

The Web UI, shell CLI, and `cao-ops-mcp` send management requests into CAO.
Event plugins receive events from CAO and send them outward. A bidirectional
integration therefore needs both an inbound command path and an outbound
event plugin.

All inbound surfaces ultimately use the HTTP API. See the
[API overview](api.md) for route families and generated OpenAPI for individual
HTTP operations. For every surface but one that API is the `cao-server` on this
machine; `cao fleet` and `cao worker` reach the same routes on a *remote*
`cao-server`, one per agent, through a broker.

## Web UI

The browser dashboard is bundled with `cao-server` and is the simplest surface
for interactively inspecting sessions and terminals. Its setup, remote-access,
and frontend-development details live in the [Web UI guide](web-ui.md).

## Shell CLI

Use `cao session` commands for scripts, CI, cron, or any caller that can execute
shell commands. `cao launch` creates sessions and `cao shutdown` removes them.
The canonical command reference and agent-facing procedure are in the
[session-management skill](../skills/cao-session-management/SKILL.md#commands).

## Remote fleets

`cao fleet` and `cao worker` manage agents that are not on this machine. Every
other surface here addresses the `cao-server` beside it; these two address a
cluster, where each agent has a `cao-server` of its own inside its own pod.

The distinction is worth keeping straight because two commands are one word
apart and neither can do the other's job. `cao shutdown` removes sessions on
this machine. `cao fleet shutdown` releases workers in a cluster, and the
sessions inside them go with the workers.

Two variables are the whole configuration:

```bash
export CAO_ELASTIC_BROKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9890   # a port-forward is enough
export CAO_ELASTIC_BROKER_TOKEN=...
cao fleet status
```

`cao fleet status` summarises the fleet and `cao fleet shutdown` empties it.
`cao worker list` names the workers, and the per-worker verbs — `status`, `send`,
`sessions`, `attach`, `logs`, `release` — are `cao session`'s verbs pointed at
one of them. Note that the broker's lease record is what `list` reads, so it
also answers the question a deleted pod cannot: why a worker is gone.

The cluster side is a reference implementation rather than part of CAO: the
commands speak four HTTP routes and know nothing about Kubernetes, so any
scheduler that serves those routes can be driven by them. See
[`examples/cao-clusters/kubernetes/eks/`](../examples/cao-clusters/kubernetes/eks/)
for the broker, the manifests, and the contract itself.

## `cao-ops-mcp` server

`cao-ops-mcp` exposes operations such as profile installation, session launch,
and session inspection as typed MCP tools. Use it when a primary agent outside
CAO already speaks MCP and benefits from tool discovery and structured
arguments. The server forwards operations to a running `cao-server`; it does
not replace the in-session `cao-mcp-server`.

Start `cao-server` before the MCP server. By default, both use
`http://localhost:9889`; when CAO uses a custom endpoint, set `CAO_API_HOST` and
`CAO_API_PORT` in the MCP server environment to match it.

For Claude Code, add this stdio server to `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cao-ops-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator.git@main",
        "cao-ops-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For other MCP clients, configure the equivalent stdio command:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator.git@main cao-ops-mcp-server
```

The current tools are grouped by purpose:

- Profiles: `list_profiles`, `get_profile_details`, `install_profile`
- Launch and messaging: `launch_session`, `send_session_message`
- Terminal inspection: `read_session_output`, `get_terminal_status`,
  `get_terminal_output`
- Session lifecycle: `list_sessions`, `get_session_info`, `shutdown_session`

Installed [plugins](plugins.md#mcp-tool-surfaces) can register additional tools on this
server through `on_mcp_server`, the same hook `cao-mcp-server` honours.

`launch_session` returns the resolved `provider` alongside `session_name` and
`terminal_id`, so a caller can confirm a worker landed on the provider it asked
for before sending work. CAO stores session names with a `cao-` prefix
(`launch_session(session_name="acc-1")` creates `cao-acc-1`); the name-taking
tools accept either the stored name or the bare name you passed at launch.

MCP tool discovery is authoritative for clients. The declarations in
[`ops_mcp_server/server.py`](../src/cli_agent_orchestrator/ops_mcp_server/server.py)
are the source of truth when the server surface changes.

For a runnable walkthrough of the full lifecycle — discover, launch, poll for
readiness, follow up, read output, shut down — see
[`examples/ops-mcp/`](../examples/ops-mcp/). It also documents the boundary
between this external plane and in-session orchestration, and the readiness
polling that `launch_session` requires because it returns before the provider is
up.

Choose the surface by caller:

| Caller | Preferred surface |
|---|---|
| Human in a browser | Web UI |
| Shell script, CI step, or cron job | `cao session` |
| External MCP-capable agent | `cao-ops-mcp` |
| Agent that can execute shell but not MCP | `cao session` through the skill |
| Operator of agents running in a cluster | `cao fleet` and `cao worker` |
| Custom application | [HTTP API](api.md) |

## Outbound event plugins

Event plugins are Python extensions loaded by `cao-server`. They subscribe to
lifecycle and message events and can forward those events to chat systems,
logs, metrics, or other destinations. They are event consumers, not an inbound
management protocol. They are unrelated to [Agent Plugins](agent-plugins.md),
which are portable packages of skills and MCP servers.

The [event plugins guide](plugins.md) owns installation, supported events,
troubleshooting, and authoring. The
[`cao-plugin` skill](../skills/cao-plugin/SKILL.md) provides guided
scaffolding.
