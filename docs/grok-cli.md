# Grok Build CLI Provider

## Overview

The `grok_cli` provider runs the official [xAI Grok Build
CLI](https://docs.x.ai/build) as a long-lived, multi-turn agent in a tmux
window. Community Grok command-line clients and direct xAI API wrappers are
not supported by this provider.

CAO launches Grok's interactive TUI with inline rendering, adds the selected
agent profile and CAO skill catalog as rules, and exposes CAO orchestration
tools through MCP. Grok's own subagent system is disabled so `assign` and
`handoff` remain the only agent-delegation paths in a CAO session.

The integration was developed and tested with Grok Build `1.0.0` and the
`grok-4.5` model. Newer Grok versions may change TUI markers or native tool
names; report status or extraction regressions with `grok --version` output.

## Prerequisites

- tmux 3.3 or later
- The official `grok` executable on `PATH`
- An authenticated Grok account or an xAI API key

Install the CLI using xAI's installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
grok --version
```

Authenticate once in a normal terminal before launching it through CAO:

```bash
grok login
grok models
```

For a remote machine without a browser, use `grok login --device-auth`. Grok
also accepts an API key from `XAI_API_KEY`:

```bash
export XAI_API_KEY="xai-..."
grok models
```

Do not put an API key in an agent profile or commit it to a repository.

## Quick Start

Start `cao-server`, then install and launch a profile for Grok:

```bash
cao install developer --provider grok_cli
cao launch --agents developer --provider grok_cli
```

Profile instructions use the normal Markdown format. The body is appended to
Grok's native system prompt with `--rules`, together with the runtime CAO skill
catalog. This preserves Grok's coding-agent behavior while applying the
profile's role and protocols. The text is written to `rules.md` inside the
terminal's private `GROK_HOME` and the launch line references it with
`"$(cat …)"`, so a long profile or skill catalog never lengthens the line
typed into the pane (the tty cuts lines past 4096 bytes) and the permission
flags always come first on that line.

Set a default model in profile frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: grok_developer
description: Developer backed by Grok Build
provider: grok_cli
model: grok-4.5
role: developer
---

Implement the requested change and verify it.
```

An explicit launch override takes precedence:

```bash
cao launch --agents grok_developer --provider grok_cli --model grok-4.5
```

Use `grok models` to discover model IDs available to the authenticated
account.

## Runtime Behavior

The command has this shape:

```text
env GROK_SUBAGENTS=0 GROK_WORKFLOWS=0 GROK_GOAL=0 \
  grok --no-alt-screen --no-subagents \
  [--model MODEL] \
  [--permission-mode dontAsk --allow RULE ... --deny RULE ... | --always-approve] \
  [--rules "$(cat GROK_HOME/rules.md)"]
```

- `--no-alt-screen` keeps the rendered conversation observable by CAO.
- With `allowedTools: ["*"]`, `--always-approve` keeps unrestricted sessions
  unattended. For a restricted profile, CAO instead uses Grok's deny-by-default
  `--permission-mode dontAsk`, explicitly grants mapped native tools and known
  MCP servers, and adds native `--deny` rules as defense in depth.
- Grok may retain built-in read-only behavior in some permission modes. That is
  a provider limitation outside CAO's `allowedTools` vocabulary: an explicit
  empty CAO allowlist sends `--deny *`, while restricted profiles explicitly
  grant only the mapped native/MCP families below. Recheck this behavior after a
  Grok CLI upgrade.
- `--no-subagents`, `GROK_SUBAGENTS=0`, `GROK_WORKFLOWS=0`, and
  `GROK_GOAL=0` prevent Grok-native workers, workflows, and `/goal` from
  bypassing CAO roles, permissions, callbacks, or terminal accounting. This
  combination was verified against Grok Build 1.0.0; recheck it after a Grok
  upgrade because these controls are not all shown by `grok --help`.
- A single Enter submits bracketed-paste input. `/quit` exits the session.
- A usage-limit picker (`You hit your weekly limit.` drawn inside the picker box,
  with `Upgrade tier` / `Buy more credits` / `Try Again` options and a
  `Tab:next answer` footer) is classified as ERROR instead of leaving the
  terminal on the stale PROCESSING marker of the turn that hit the limit. A
  waiting `handoff` then fails as soon as the picker is seen, with the generic
  "worker errored"/terminal-ERROR message; the picker's own text is not
  propagated to the caller. Other pickers of the same shape (`Tab:next answer`,
  `Enter:submit`) read as WAITING_USER_ANSWER. Both classifications require the
  picker to be the newest thing on screen: status is read from an append-only
  raw buffer, so a picker a later frame erased or a transcript that quotes one
  loses to the newer processing frame and the turn keeps running.
- A stale raw-FIFO `Waiting for response…` marker can outlive the turn it came
  from (#813). For a quiet terminal stuck on PROCESSING, CAO re-checks the
  rendered pane and honors a ready verdict only after two matching reads, and
  only when PROCESSING was re-established from provider evidence after the last
  dispatch. A full re-delivery of a dropped paste is another delivery attempt
  of the same logical turn rather than a new turn, so a genuinely successful
  resend can still complete even though it is the second paste CAO sent.
  Grok Build 1.0.41 can paint a right-edge scrollbar beside the completion
  marker and across blank rows. Rendered recovery removes that scrollbar and
  its cell padding only when the composer width and repeated blank rows agree;
  response extraction uses display-cell widths to preserve Unicode text.
  When a per-cell redraw omits the query marker, an exact echo of the dispatched
  text followed by busy chrome can establish the current query. The completed
  pane must still show that same distinct query; clock suffixes do not establish
  a new query or turn.
- Completion attribution requires an independently attributable current-turn
  signal; a busy frame is not one. A completion is attributed to the current
  turn after a dispatch reset only when its query differs from the predecessor's
  query and matches attributable current processing evidence. Within the SAME
  buffer generation, an advanced stream position can establish a later
  completion. Grok can emit the busy frame
  and the finished frame in one FIFO burst, so a busy frame cannot be required
  either — but neither can it stand in for ownership. A dropped paste whose old
  busy frame and old finished frame are replayed after the dispatch boundary
  produces exactly the bytes of a genuine byte-identical repeat, and the rolling
  stream coordinate space restarts at that reset, so neither the generation
  change nor the spinner proves which turn drew them.
- Completion fingerprints ignore whitespace so raw cursor-positioned output and
  rendered panes, including indentation and wrapping changes, identify the same
  completion. Whitespace alone cannot prove that another turn ran.
- The safety trade-off for that rule is explicit: a repeated query separated by
  a dispatch-boundary reset stays PROCESSING even if the answer or duration
  changes. Raw streams retain transient busy chrome that rendered panes erase,
  so a changed fingerprint cannot prove a new turn. Prefix-related query
  fragments are also ambiguous: a shorter visible line may be a soft-wrapped
  predecessor query. Such queries, and unmatched queries without attributable
  processing evidence, stay PROCESSING. CAO prefers to fail closed
  here and let its dropped-paste re-delivery and timeout paths decide, rather
  than ever report a turn that may never have run. The first turn is exempt (it
  has no predecessor) and is the #813 recovery case itself; a replay that brings
  only the old screen back with no fresh generation still reads PROCESSING.

### Native workflow opt-in

CAO-managed terminals disable Grok-native workers by default, including when
`allowedTools: ["*"]` is used. Tool permission is not consent to bypass CAO's
orchestration accounting. To intentionally let this specific Grok profile use
native subagents, workflows, and `/goal`, set the typed profile field:

```yaml
---
name: grok_experimental
provider: grok_cli
grokNativeWorkflows: true
---
```

With this opt-in CAO launches Grok with `GROK_SUBAGENTS=1`,
`GROK_WORKFLOWS=1`, and `GROK_GOAL=1`, and omits `--no-subagents`. CAO's MCP
tools remain available to the top-level Grok session, but any Grok-native
workers are outside CAO's profile selection, callback routing, and terminal
accounting. Do not enable this setting where those CAO controls are required.

The empty `❯` composer may remain visible while Grok is working. CAO therefore
prioritizes current `Waiting for response…` and `Esc:cancel` markers over the
composer. A settled turn has a `Worked for ...` boundary, which CAO also uses
to extract only the latest response in a multi-turn session.

## MCP Isolation

CAO creates a private Grok home for every terminal and launches Grok with
`GROK_HOME` pointing to it. The terminal root is mode `0700`; CAO writes its
generated config atomically with mode `0600`. It does not run `grok mcp add`
and does not modify the user's `~/.grok/config.toml`.

The isolated config contains the profile's MCP servers, plus any declared by
installed [agent plugins](agent-plugins.md) — merged at launch time and
recomputed on every terminal creation rather than persisted, so the paths never
go stale. Grok names the streamable-HTTP transport `http`, so CAO writes a
`streamable-http` server as `type = "http"`; `sse` is preserved as `sse`. CAO
injects the terminal-specific `CAO_TERMINAL_ID` into stdio MCP server
environments so `cao-mcp-server` can route `assign`, `handoff`, and
`send_message` correctly.
Existing login state is reused without copying credential contents into CAO
logs or the repository. Generated state is removed when the terminal is
cleaned up.

A newly isolated home can show Grok's `Help improve Grok` telemetry choice.
The banner is non-blocking and is ignored by CAO's status and response
extraction logic.

CAO never automatically accepts Grok's directory-trust screen. Accepting it
would enable project-local MCP, LSP, and hook configuration under the terminal
user's privileges; selecting No quits Grok. If that screen is detected, CAO
fails startup with an actionable error. Review and remove project-local
configuration such as `.mcp.json` or `.grok/` before launching the CAO
terminal, or use standalone Grok when you intentionally want to trust it.


### Agent-plugin MCP working directory

Its MCP config format has no working-directory key (checked against the vendor's own MCP documentation, 2026-09-16), so CAO carries an agent plugin's declared `cwd` by launching the server through `/bin/sh -c 'cd -- "$1" && shift && exec "$@"'`. `exec` replaces the shell, the environment passes through, and argument boundaries survive because each argument stays a separate argv element. On a host with no `/bin/sh` such a server is skipped with `mcp.cwd_unsupported` rather than started in the wrong directory.
See [Agent Plugins](agent-plugins.md) for the full per-provider table.

## Tool Restrictions

Grok is a hard-enforcement provider. CAO translates missing capabilities into
native Grok deny rules:

| CAO capability | Grok tools denied when absent |
|---|---|
| `execute_bash` | `Bash` |
| `fs_read` | `Read`, `NotebookRead` |
| `fs_write` | `Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit` |
| `fs_list` | `Grep`, `Glob` |
| `web_fetch` | `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, with web search disabled |

`allowedTools: ["*"]` adds no restrictive deny rules. It does not enable
Grok-native delegation: CAO keeps subagents, workflows, and `/goal` disabled
unless a profile explicitly sets `grokNativeWorkflows: true`, so `assign` and
`handoff` remain the accountable orchestration mechanisms by default. For a
restricted role, CAO uses `--permission-mode dontAsk` and emits explicit
`--allow` rules for the mapped native tools and configured MCP server names.
It also retains explicit native denies as defense in depth. Arbitrary
`@server` strings never become Grok MCP permission patterns: a server name must
be a literal Grok-safe identifier and be either `cao-mcp-server` or configured
in that profile's `mcpServers` block.

`@cao-mcp-server` grants Grok's configured CAO MCP server as an all-or-nothing
server-level rule in a restricted profile. CAO does not yet express a rule for
an individual MCP tool such as `send_message` without `assign`; see [Tool
Restrictions](tool-restrictions.md).

## Assign and Handoff Example

Install all profiles for this provider before running the full orchestration
example:

```bash
cao install examples/assign/data_analyst.md --provider grok_cli
cao install examples/assign/report_generator.md --provider grok_cli
cao install examples/assign/analysis_supervisor.md --provider grok_cli
cao launch --agents analysis_supervisor --provider grok_cli --auto-approve
```

`--auto-approve` skips CAO's launch confirmation but retains role-based tool
restrictions. Do not substitute `--yolo` when validating supervisor safety.

## Known Limitations

- The provider targets Grok Build's interactive TUI and currently requires the
  tmux backend. Headless `-p` and ACP modes are not CAO transports.
- TUI parsing is calibrated against Grok Build 1.0.0; the usage-limit picker
  fixture was captured on 1.0.13. A future layout change may require updated
  status and extraction fixtures.
- CAO reuses existing Grok authentication. Complete interactive login first;
  CAO does not drive account or device-code login screens.
- Per-tool MCP gating is not available. `@cao-mcp-server` does not selectively
  hide `assign`, `handoff`, or `send_message`.
- Grok-created non-secret files inside the private `0700` home can use their
  own modes; the `0600` guarantee applies to CAO-authored config files.

## Troubleshooting

### Login or model errors

Run `grok login` and `grok models` outside CAO. On a headless host, use
`grok login --device-auth` or set `XAI_API_KEY`. If a profile selects an
unavailable model, replace it with an ID printed by `grok models`.

### MCP tools are missing or time out

Confirm `cao-mcp-server` is installed in the same environment as `cao-server`.
Inspect the Grok terminal for an MCP startup error, then recreate the terminal
so CAO regenerates its isolated config and terminal ID.

### Terminal remains processing

Attach to the tmux session and check whether Grok still shows
`Waiting for response…` or `Esc:cancel`. If Grok is visibly settled but CAO
does not report completion, include a scrubbed pane capture and `grok --version`
in the bug report.

### Permission or telemetry prompt is visible

The telemetry banner is non-blocking. An actual permission picker should be
reported as waiting for user input; answer it in tmux. Restricted tool calls
should be denied automatically rather than prompting.

### Broken rendering

Use tmux 3.3 or later and a normal color terminal such as
`TERM=xterm-256color` or `TERM=tmux-256color`. Verify `grok --no-alt-screen`
works in a standalone tmux pane.
