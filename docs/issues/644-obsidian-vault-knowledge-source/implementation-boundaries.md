# Implementation boundaries

**Issue:** [#644](https://github.com/awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator/issues/644)
**Status:** Planning record. No unit has been implemented.
**Revision:** 3, amended — U2 gains three migration corrections, U5 gains a security review and the N1 predicate, U6 gains a static assertion, and the predicate site list grows from thirteen to seventeen. Amended after the supervisor corrected the test-baseline premise: **CI on `main` at `6c890ca` is GREEN**, so U5's contract is written against a **working** lint subsystem. Last pass before implementation.
**Related:** [design.md](design.md), [test-strategy.md](test-strategy.md), [traceability.md](traceability.md)

## Sizing rule

Each unit is one pull request, reviewable on its own, green on its own, and mergeable to
`main` without the units after it. Two consequences shape the split:

- **Every unit before `vault-recall` is inert in production.** The feature is gated by
  `memory.vault.enabled`, default false, and by requiring a configured vault. Units 1
  through 5 can land in any release without changing behavior for a single existing user
  — with one exception noted in U2, which touches a shared table.
- **No unit leaves the tree in a state where a half-built path is reachable.** In
  particular no exposure surface lands before the gate it depends on.

Unit names are the branch-name stems.

## Revision 3 changes

| Change | Unit | Driver |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `promotion_service.plan()` gains `source_kind == 'native'` — it read a row's `file_path` with **no confinement** and promoted the content into a persistent agent system prompt | **U5** (earlier than required) | N1 [HIGH] |
| A 16th predicate site, `memory_service.py:1388` `_candidate_keys_for_topic`, whose absence lets native and vault keys contaminate each other's `related_keys` | U6 | N3 [MED] |
| `ck_related_keys_length` **omitted** from the rebuilt table | U2 | ruling R12 |
| The idempotence gate becomes a **column-list comparison**, because a named table-level UNIQUE discards its name and a name check can never match | U2 | N5 |
| Index-recreation **ordering** relative to `_migrate_memory_indexes` pinned and asserted | U2 | N6 |
| Site list corrected: **17**, not 13, with `compact()`'s scope filter at **1271** not 1275 | U2 | reviewer |
| Secret gate runs at **index time**, quarantining under `reject` and reporting under `warn` | U3, U4 | ruling R5 |
| **U5 gets a security review** with its own reviewer-confirm list and teeth test | U5 | ruling R13 |
| The five-consumer enumeration is replaced, as enforcement, by a **static assertion** | U6 | reviewer framing |
| `GraphView.meta` distinguishes three causes for absent lint enrichment | U9 | self-identified |
| Every new refusal guard gets **its own test that passes on the current tree** | U5 | self-identified |
| U5's identity-diff becomes a **gate**, with the baseline identities **and the exact invocation** recorded — the local failure set is invocation-dependent, so comparing across invocations manufactures phantom regressions | U5 | supervisor baseline, amended |

### Revision 2 changes

| Change | Driver |
| --- | --- |
| U2 grows substantially: the R2 constraint widening is a **SQLite table rebuild**, `source_kind` must be **NOT NULL DEFAULT 'native'**, and a list of query sites gains a predicate (thirteen as of revision 2; seventeen as of revision 3). U2 is the highest-risk unit in the plan and ships alone | F3, ruling R2 |
| U2 owns all seventeen `source_kind` predicates, including `wiki_lint`, `wiki_healer`, and `promotion_service`; U5 owns the separate behavioural refusals in `wiki_healer`, `cleanup_service`, and `binding.py` | R15 |
| U6 gains the **vault `Memory` builder** — without it AC3 and AC4 are unreachable — plus the OKF export refusal, and its byte-identical claim is restated honestly | F2, F6, F7, F9 |
| U7 gains the **curator recall gate** and becomes the unit that closes F1 | F1, ruling R1 |
| U8 gains the **`ForgetResult`** return shape and both `SKILL.md` copies | F11, F10, ruling R3 |
| U9 joins the **security-review list**, must land **after U7**, and projects only `status='indexed'` notes | F12, directed fix D3 |
| U12's targets corrected: `docs/settings.md` and `docs/configuration.md` **already exist** | F10 correction |
| F16 CodeQL discipline added to the U4, U6 and U8 review checklists | F16 |

## Unit list

| # | Unit | Depends on | Security review | Rough size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U1 | `vault-config` | — | **Yes** | Medium |
| U2 | `vault-schema` | — | **Yes** | **Large** |
| U3 | `vault-parse` | U1 | **Yes** | Medium |
| U4 | `vault-scan` | U1, U3 | **Yes** | Medium |
| U5 | `vault-reconcile` | U2, U4 | **Yes** | Large |
| U6 | `vault-recall` | U5 | **Yes** | Large |
| U7 | `vault-inject-gate` | U6 | **Yes** | Medium |
| U8 | `vault-write` | U5, U6 | **Yes** | Large |
| U9 | `vault-graph` | U5, **U7** | **Yes** | Small |
| U10 | `vault-migrate` | U8 | No | Medium |
| U11 | `vault-cli` | U5, U7, U8, U10 | No | Medium |
| U12 | `vault-docs` | U11 | No | Small |

**Eight of twelve** carry a security review. Revision 2 added U2 and U9; revision 3 adds
U5 (ruling R13). The reasoning is the same class in all three cases: U2 because a
constraint widening on a shared table can silently destroy an invariant; U9 because
`Node.label` is the key and a key encodes structure; U5 because its four maintenance
refusals are the only thing standing between an unattended job — `cleanup_service` at
90-day project retention, `wiki_healer --apply` on an LLM's judgement — and the silent
de-indexing of a user's vault notes. A refusal is a security control even though it is
three lines of predicate.

U9's edge from U7 is new in revision 2 and is a policy constraint, not a technical one.

## Ordering constraints that are policy not convenience

Two edges must not be relaxed for scheduling reasons.

1. **U7 immediately after U6.** There must be no release in which vault content is
   recallable and the injection policy is not yet enforced. U6 is the first unit that
   changes behavior for a configured user; U7 is what makes the second of the issue's two
   mandated policies real.
2. **U9 after U7.** `Node.label` is the key, and a path-derived key encodes folder path
   and filename, so the graph is an exposure surface reaching `GraphView`, the MCP Apps
   `ui://cao` views and the browser dashboard. U9 must project through the chokepoint U7
   establishes, with the same `status='indexed'` predicate, so graph exposure equals recall
   exposure rather than exceeding it. Landing U9 first would publish quarantined notes'
   keys — that is, their paths and titles — for notes deliberately excluded from recall.

## Units in detail

### U1 — `vault-config`

**Ships.** `services/vault/config.py` with `VaultConfig`, `VaultSpec`, `FolderMapping`
and all **twenty** validation rules from
[adr-007-configuration-surface.md](adr-007-configuration-surface.md).
`settings_service.get_vault_config()`. `vault` on `config_service.MemoryConfig`.
`CAO_MEMORY_VAULT_ENABLED` in `ENV_REGISTRY`. `services/vault/findings.py` with the closed
finding vocabulary and the supported-boundary table from
[adr-004-supported-markdown-boundary.md](adr-004-supported-markdown-boundary.md) as data.

**Does not ship.** Any read of a note. Any database access. Any CLI command.

**Revision 2 note.** Rules 7 and 8 are the D1 correction: a mapping's `folder` is
validated for shape and containment but **not** against a character allowlist, while
`managed_folder` is charset-validated because it feeds `safe_join_under_base`. Getting
this backwards — as revision 1 did — makes the feature unconfigurable against any vault
containing a folder with a space or a non-ASCII character.

**Reviewable in isolation because** its whole surface is "given this JSON, does it load
and with what error". Tests are table-driven over valid and invalid documents.

### U2 — `vault-schema`

**Ships.** Three tables (`vault_note`, `vault_finding`, `vault_note_alias`), one column
(`memory_metadata.source_kind`), one **widened unique constraint**, and the
`source_kind` predicate on **seventeen** existing queries.

**Why this is now the largest-risk unit.** Three things compound:

1. **`source_kind` must be `TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'native'`, not nullable.** SQLite treats
   `NULL != NULL` inside a UNIQUE index, so a nullable discriminator makes the widened
   constraint **inert for every native row** — native duplicate keys become insertable and
   an invariant that has held since Phase 2 silently disappears. `RELATIONSHIP_SCOPE_ID_SENTINEL`
   (`database.py:139`) exists for exactly this reason and its comment is the precedent;
   `access_count`'s `nullable=False, default=0, server_default="0"` is the precedent for the
   no-backfill add.
2. **Widening a UNIQUE constraint in SQLite is a table rebuild.** There is no
   `ALTER ... ADD CONSTRAINT`. Create `memory_metadata_new`, `INSERT ... SELECT ...,
   'native'`, drop, rename, recreate the three indexes — one transaction, gated on
   `PRAGMA index_list`/`index_info` so a second `init_db()` is a no-op.
3. **There is no drift guard on this table.** Verified: the `_REQUIRED_*_COLUMNS` equality
   pattern exists only for `workflow_run` and `workflow_run_step` in
   `services/workflow_journal.py`. Nothing fails loudly if a mirror is missed, so the
   thirteen-site list in [design.md](design.md) must be worked through mechanically.

**The seventeen sites**, by path and line: `memory_service.py` 341, 395, **1271**, 1388,
1480, 2089, 2126; `memory_reconciliation.py` 608, 948; `memory_relationship_service.py`
286, 805; `wiki_healer.py` 270, 317, 453, 681; `promotion_service.py` 136;
`wiki_lint.py` 1002-1004. The full table with each site's consequence is in
[design.md](design.md).

Three corrections from revision 2, each of which would have left a real predicate
unpatched:

- **`compact()`'s scope filter is at 1271, not 1275.** Line 1275 is only the optional
  `key ==` clause. Since this unit's spec says the list is to be worked through
  mechanically, a wrong line number *is* a missed predicate — the mechanical process would
  have patched a line that needed nothing.
- **`memory_reconciliation.py:608` has no filter at all** — `db.query(MemoryMetadataModel).all()`,
  feeding `_load_rows()` for `cao memory repair`.
- **`wiki_lint.py:1002-1004`** was named in design.md's component table but absent from the
  enumeration, which is exactly the failure mode a mechanical list is supposed to prevent.

Where the correct behavior is "native-only code must not see vault rows", the predicate is
`source_kind = 'native'` and is simultaneously the F9 guard.
`memory_service.py:1388` is the one site that is neither native-only nor binding-aware: it
must filter to the **same** backend as the topic it is computing candidates for.

**Ships alone.** No other content in the pull request. This is the one unit that is *not*
inert for existing users: it rewrites a shared table on the next `init_db()`.

**Three migration corrections from the revision-2 review**, each of which would have made
U2 misbehave permanently rather than loudly:

- **`ck_related_keys_length` is OMITTED from the rebuilt table** (ruling R12). The
  existing comment in `database.py` states that CHECK applies to fresh databases only and
  that existing databases rely on the parse-side cap in `_parse_related_keys`, so omitting
  it makes the rebuilt table behave identically to the one it replaces. U2 then changes
  uniqueness and nothing else, which is what a constraint-widening migration should do.
  `substr` truncation was rejected outright — silently destroying data during a uniqueness
  migration is the one thing it must never do — and pre-scan-and-refuse was rejected as
  still blocking startup.
- **The idempotence gate is a column-list comparison, not a name check** (N5). A named
  table-level `UNIQUE` in SQLite produces `sqlite_autoindex_<table>_1` with `origin='u'`,
  and **the name `uq_memory_key_scope` is discarded** — it never appears in
  `PRAGMA index_list`. A name-based gate can therefore never match, and the migration would
  rebuild a shared table on **every** `init_db()`, forever, with no error to notice. The
  gate must enumerate `PRAGMA index_list(memory_metadata)`, keep `origin='u'` rows, and
  compare each one's `PRAGMA index_info` column list against
  `('key','scope','scope_id','source_kind')`.
- **Index-recreation ordering must be pinned** (N6). `idx_memory_scope`,
  `idx_memory_updated` and `idx_memory_type` are created at `database.py:386`, `:389`,
  `:392` by the **separate** idempotent `_migrate_memory_indexes()` using
  `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`. If the rebuild runs **before** that function, it need not
  recreate them; if **after**, it must recreate all three or they are silently lost until
  the next process start. Pin the position explicitly.

**Tests.** Fresh database; a database created before the change; `init_db()` twice is a
no-op **and performs no second rebuild** (the N5 assertion — count rebuilds, do not just
check the end state); the widened constraint rejects a duplicate
`(key, scope, scope_id, 'native')`; a duplicate native key is **still** rejected after the
widening (the assertion that catches the nullable mistake); all three secondary indexes
exist after migration on both a fresh and a pre-existing database (N6); the rebuilt table
carries no `ck_related_keys_length` and an over-long `related_keys` value survives the
rebuild unmodified (R12); and every one of the seventeen sites carries its predicate.

### U3 — `vault-parse`

**Ships.** `parser.py`, `identity.py`, `links.py`. All pure: no filesystem, no database.
Bounded frontmatter parse with the byte cap, safe loader, anchor/alias rejection. `cao`
block validation **importing** `VALID_TYPES`, `VALID_STATUSES`, `VALID_ORIGINS` from
`memory_relationship_service` rather than re-declaring them. `cao_key` extraction and the
mapping-relative path-derived fallback **with its stable digest suffix** (F14 — without it
`_sanitize_key`'s 60-character truncation silently collides long-titled notes in nested
folders). `note_uid` derivation. Wikilink resolution to the five outcomes. The
frontmatter-region preservation map the writer later uses.

**Also ships (ruling R5).** The `secret_detected` finding code and the pure
`scan_for_secrets`-based classification, so the index-time gate's decision is a testable
function of content with no I/O. The severity is **mapping-dependent** — `error` under
`secret_gate: "reject"`, `warn` under `"warn"` — which no other finding in the vocabulary
is, so `findings.py` must model severity as a function of configuration for this one code
rather than a constant.

**Does not ship.** Reading a file from disk. Writing anything.

### U4 — `vault-scan`

**Ships.** `scan.py`. Sorted traversal, exclusion application, always-excluded paths,
symlink refusal via `memory_reconciliation._first_symlink_component`, **hardlink refusal**
(`st_nlink > 1`, with the per-mapping `allow_hardlinks` escape hatch), `max_note_bytes` and
`max_notes`, the two-stat stability check, sync-conflict filename refusal, UTF-8 strictness,
line-ending normalization before hashing, `content_sha256` and `frontmatter_sha256`. A
frozen deterministic `ScanReport`. **And the index-time secret gate** (ruling R5): each
candidate's body is passed through `scan_for_secrets`, and a match quarantines the note
under `reject` or records the finding under `warn`. It runs here rather than at read time
because it is a pure function of content — free per read, re-run only when the content hash
changes, and deterministic under `rebuild`.

**Does not ship.** Any database write. Any vault write.

**F16 obligation.** `scan.py` owns its own `open()` sinks and re-asserts
`real_path.startswith(root + os.sep)` inline beside each one, in the single positive form,
taking and returning bare `str`.

### U5 — `vault-reconcile`

**Ships.** `reconcile.py`, `binding.py`, `status.py`. Plan and apply. Rename absorption.
Upserts into `vault_note`, `vault_finding`, `vault_note_alias`, `memory_metadata`
(`source_kind='vault'`), and `replace_set` of `origin="vault"` edges. The full-rebuild
path with scoped deletes. The frozen report. Three audit events added to
`NOWAIT_AUDIT_EVENTS`: `vault_reconcile_completed`, `vault_note_quarantined`, and
`vault_secret_quarantined`. Registration deliberately precedes emission: the closed audit
whitelist otherwise drops an event silently. `origin = "vault"` in `VALID_ORIGINS` and its
two other enumerating sites. **Alias-aware `scope_id` canonicalisation** in
`binding.resolve()` plus the orphaned-mapping and `unmapped_project_write` warnings (F13).

**R15 ownership split.** U2 owns every `source_kind` predicate at all seventeen sites,
including the predicates in `wiki_lint.py`, `wiki_healer.py`, and
`promotion_service.py`. U5 owns the distinct behavioural refusals below and `binding.py`.
`cleanup_service.py` is not a predicate site.

- `wiki_healer.py` — refuses vault-bound scopes early. Otherwise
  `cao memory heal --apply` reaches `_delete_row` (line 306) for a note whose native path
  does not exist: no file is unlinked, but the **metadata row is deleted** — a silent
  de-index of a user's vault note on an LLM's judgement. Unreachable today only by
  accident.
- `cleanup_service.py` — refuses vault-bound scopes. Otherwise the retention sweep parses
  a stale native `index.md` and calls `forget()` at line 195, de-indexing vault rows
  unattended at 90-day retention for a scope that used to be native.
- `binding.py` — resolves mappings alias-aware and supplies content-free warnings for
  orphaned mappings, cwd-hash project scope ids, and unmapped project writes.

**Placement note.** The review said "fix N1 before U7"; it lands in U5 instead, which is
strictly earlier. U5 is where vault `memory_metadata` rows first exist, so any later
placement leaves a window; and the edit is the same class as the other three guards, so it
belongs on the same reviewer checklist. The *exploitable* window opens slightly later —
`DEFAULT_MIN_ACCESS_COUNT` is 3 and a vault row cannot reach 3 until recall exists in U6 —
so U5 placement closes the hole before it opens. **Mitigating factor, which lowers
likelihood and not severity:** the vault `Memory` builder defaults an absent `cao.type` to
`reference`, and `PROMOTABLE_TYPES` is `("feedback","project")`, so exploitation needs a
note carrying an explicit `cao.type: project` or `cao.type: feedback`.

**Does not ship.** Any change to `recall()`, `store()` or injection. After this unit derived
state builds and rebuilds, and nothing reads it.

**U5 may assume the lint subsystem works.** CI on `main` at `6c890ca` — this unit's exact
base — is **green across three consecutive runs**. An earlier brief described the lint, heal
and graph-cache subsystem as "already red on `main`"; that was a measurement of one
developer machine, not of the tree, and it has been retracted. Write U5's contract against a
functioning subsystem: there is no "best-effort-and-possibly-dead" allowance.

**Every guard still gets its own new test that passes on the current tree.** The reason is
not the subsystem's health, it is where the assertion lives. `TestMemoryHeal` and
`test_wiki_lint.py` may be red **on the implementer's machine** for local-environment
reasons, and an assertion bolted into a class that errors before reaching it can appear
covered while never executing. So each of the four guards needs a fresh test function in a
new file, green locally and in CI. This requirement is independent of the baseline question
and survives its correction intact.

**The identity diff is a GATE, not advice — and the invocation is part of the gate.** The
local failure set is **invocation-dependent**: running the four affected files in isolation
produces 25 failures, while the same files inside the full run produce 18. A set measured
one way and compared against a set measured the other way would manufacture phantom
regressions, which is worse than no baseline at all. So U5 records **the identities and the
exact command that produced them**, takes the baseline with the **CI-exact invocation**, and
compares against a run using that same invocation.

**CI is the arbiter.** A red local run on a developer machine is a **local-environment
artifact to be diagnosed as such** — two of the observed failures are timestamp-rendering
tests (`TestT3DetectedAtVisible::test_cli_json_uses_iso8601_z_suffix`,
`test_cli_table_renders_detected_at`), consistent with a timezone or library-version
difference rather than broken logic. It is never to be "fixed" inside a vault pull request:
repairing an unrelated subsystem there makes the diff unreviewable, and if the failure is
environmental there is nothing to repair.

**Watch items.** `AUDIT_EVENT_WHITELIST` is closed — an unlisted event is dropped silently,
which would make a content-free-audit assertion pass vacuously. Register all three events
(`vault_reconcile_completed`, `vault_note_quarantined`, `vault_secret_quarantined`) before
their U5-B emission sites; registration and emission need not land in the same commit. The
rebuild determinism test lands here, with the two-group dump split from
[test-strategy.md](test-strategy.md).

### U6 — `vault-recall`

**Ships.** `services/vault/reader.py` — **the candidate chokepoint**:
`resolve_candidates()` with its no-default `require_injectable` parameter,
`load_candidate()`, and **the vault `Memory` builder**.

The builder is not optional polish. `_parse_wiki_file` (line 2601) does
`timestamps = re.findall(r"## (\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}Z)", ...)` then
`if not timestamps: return None`, and **both** readbacks drop falsy results — line 2237 in
`_metadata_recall` and line 2470 in `_bm25_search`. An ordinary Obsidian note would be
discovered, ranked, and then thrown away, making AC3 and AC4 unreachable. The builder must
be wired into **both** sites, with the field mapping in [design.md](design.md), and the
vault arms must never call `_parse_wiki_file`.

Also ships: `MemoryService` consults `binding.py` in `recall()`; a new `_resolve_sources()`
**added beside** an unchanged `_get_search_dirs()`; the vault arm of `_metadata_recall`;
corpus-provider parameterization of `_bm25_search` and `_bm25_relevance` **plus the
trailing keyword parameter on `_apply_sort_and_increment`**, which is `_bm25_relevance`'s
only caller (line 1997) and is therefore unavoidable — revision 1 claimed both that the
corpus was parameterized and that this method did not change, and both cannot be true;
one-read-per-candidate on the vault BM25 arm (T2-minor); vault related-expansion routed
through the chokepoint (F8); read-time re-confinement inline at the sink; the body budget
and `token_estimate` (F15); freshness stamping; `source_kind`, `source_path`,
`indexed_at`, `index_freshness`, `content_truncated` on `Memory`, on `MemorySummary` and
`MemoryDetail`, and in the MCP `memory_recall` mapping; and the **OKF export refusal** for
vault-bound scopes in `export_memories()` (today `_collect_topics` walks native paths and
silently produces an empty bundle).

**Honest byte-identical claim (F7).** `_get_search_dirs` is retained **unchanged**. Every
new parameter on an existing method is a **trailing keyword argument with a
native-preserving default**, and a call that does not use it keeps its current form rather
than passing an explicit `None`. That keeps the existing recall tests passing unmodified,
which is stronger evidence than an edited assertion.

**Watch items.** `_bm25_relevance`'s docstring explains why the corpus must be the full
document population — a candidate-only corpus collapses IDF when every candidate contains
the query term; the vault provider must yield the whole indexed scope. Before changing any
injection-adjacent signature, grep for code that **replaces** the function rather than
calling it: a module-level monkeypatch in this suite assigns a two-parameter lambda over
`terminal_service.inject_memory_context`.

**F16 obligation.** `reader.py` owns every taint-reachable read sink with the guard inline
and returns a `Memory` or bytes, never a path.

**The chokepoint invariant is enforced by a static assertion, not by a consumer list
(N1/N3).** Revision 2 enumerated five consumers and claimed the gate was total; the review
then found two more read paths the sweep had missed — `promotion_service` and
`_candidate_keys_for_topic`. An enumeration is only as good as the sweep behind it, so U6
adds to `test_no_enumeration_outside_scan.py`:

> No module outside `reader.py` may call `open` or `read_text` on a value originating from
> `memory_metadata.file_path`.

The consumer list survives in [design.md](design.md) as **non-normative orientation** —
what exists today — and the assertion is what a future author's new read path fails against.
This is the only form in which "provable rather than asserted" is actually provable.

**N3 — the 16th site.** `_candidate_keys_for_topic` (`memory_service.py:1388`) filters scope
plus scope_id with no `source_kind` and `.limit(200)`, feeding `find_related` and the LLM
compiler's candidate set. Without the predicate, a **native** memory's compile can receive
**vault** keys as related candidates and write a vault key into a native row's
`related_keys` — and the reverse — after which the contamination flows into
`_expand_related`'s legacy fallback at `:1691-1693`. Unlike the other sites this one is
neither native-only nor binding-aware: it must filter to the **same** backend as the topic
it is computing candidates for, because its purpose is intra-corpus relatedness.

### U7 — `vault-inject-gate`

**Ships.** The `require_injectable` derivation at both injection entry points, and the
curator gate that closes F1:

- `get_memory_context_for_terminal` passes `require_injectable=True` into the chokepoint,
  including for the related fan-out at line 2854.
- **A recall whose resolved terminal context is the injection curator also passes
  `require_injectable=True`** (ruling R1). `get_curated_memory_context` already locates the
  curator via `_find_context_manager_terminal(session_name)`; a curator is identified by
  its `agent_profile`.
- **Fail closed when the curator is unidentifiable**: do not dispatch, fall back to the
  gated deterministic builder.
- The `status` warning line naming injectable mappings.

**Why this is no longer a tiny unit.** Revision 1 sized it small because it believed a
filter in the builder was sufficient. It is not:
`terminal_service.inject_memory_context` (line 118) calls `get_curated_memory_context`
(line 135), whose **success path returns the curator's raw block at line 2972** and which
reaches the gated builder **only on its fallback at line 2976**.

**Watch items.** `_is_memory_enabled()` is the first line of `get_curated_memory_context`;
no new path may bypass it. Any future frozen-memory injection arm must route through the
chokepoint with `require_injectable=True`.

### U8 — `vault-write`

**Ships.** `writer.py`: `store()` branches on binding; `safe_join_under_base` composition
under `managed_folder`; the vault secret gate; `locked_atomic_rewrite` with lock and temp
files in CAO-owned locations; frontmatter merge that re-emits the original frontmatter
**text region** verbatim except the `cao` block; the `content_sha256` conflict check inside
the lock, failing visibly; post-write single-note refresh raising the existing
`MemoryPartialWriteError` shape.

**Plus the `forget()` contract change (F11, ruling R3).** `forget()` returns a frozen
`ForgetResult` whose `__bool__` returns the previous boolean, so all seven existing call
sites — `cli/commands/memory.py:215` and `:256`, `api/main.py:6849` and `:6904`,
`mcp_server/server.py:2066`, `cleanup_service.py:195`, `memory_archive/okf.py:366` — keep
behaving identically with no edit. It adds `action` (`deleted` | `deindexed` | `absent`),
`source_kind` and `path`. MCP `memory_forget` keeps `deleted`, adds `action` and `path`,
and **its docstring stops claiming "Deletes the wiki topic file"** — today it returns
`{"deleted": true}` under that docstring, so an agent is told a file was deleted when it
was not. **Both `skills/cao-memory/SKILL.md` copies** get their Forget section corrected,
edited via `python scripts/sync_skills.py`.

**Constraint.** The native `store()` arm stays byte-identical.

**F13 follow-through.** U8 owns the `record_unmapped_project_write()` call site and the
decision on a durable record. The U5 counter is intentionally process-local today, so it
cannot be presented as a durable value by a separate `cao memory vault status` process.

**F16 obligation.** `writer.py` owns every write sink with the guard inline.

### U9 — `vault-graph`

**Ships.** `MemoryGraphProvider` takes its node set from **the chokepoint**, with the same
`status='indexed'` predicate recall uses. `is_vault` node attribute. And `GraphView.meta`
reports absent lint enrichment with a **discriminated cause**, not a single "unavailable":
`disabled_by_setting` (the existing `is_memory_lint_enabled` path), `unavailable_vault`
(this scope is vault-backed, so `wiki_lint`'s `MEMORY_BASE_DIR` containment check drops its
rows by construction — a permanent design boundary in release one), or `failed` (the
existing `meta["lint_error"]` path). Revision 2 conflated the second with the third, so a
reader could not tell a deliberate boundary from a live fault. The `disabled_enrichments`
shape at `graph/providers/memory.py:82-95` is the precedent for how to report it.

Note what this is **not** fixing. `_build`'s broad `except Exception` →
`meta["lint_error"]` is genuine graceful degradation and is **not** currently firing on
`main` (CI is green at `6c890ca`), so there is no pre-existing silent-masking problem for
this change to extend. The three-cause split is worth making on its own merit: a vault user
should see a permanent design boundary and a native user should see a fault, and a single
undifferentiated "unavailable" cannot say which.

**Does not ship.** Any new `EdgeType`, so `cao_mcp_apps/src/graph/types.ts` and the web
graph components are untouched. **And no `quarantined` node attribute** — revision 1
proposed one, and it was the leak: `Node.label` is the key, a path-derived key encodes
folder structure, so a quarantined node publishes the path and title of a note that is
deliberately not recallable. No `vault_relpath` or path-shaped value appears in any node or
edge attribute.

**Security review, and it must land after U7.** See
[Ordering constraints that are policy not convenience](#ordering-constraints-that-are-policy-not-convenience).

**Watch item.** Preserve the existing constraint that the relationship read happens
**after** `wiki_lint.run_lint` — the comment above that call documents a real bug that was
fixed once.

### U10 — `vault-migrate`

**Ships.** `migrate.py`. Dry-run-first migration of a native scope into the managed folder.
Representable-metadata mapping. A lossy-field report shaped like the OKF `ImportReport`.
`--delete-source` behind `--apply` plus a second confirmation.

**Lossy fields, reported by name:** `access_count`, `last_accessed_at`,
`last_compiled_at`, `source_provider`, `source_terminal_id`, the legacy `related_keys` text
column, and append-only section history beyond what fits the managed note. Typed
`memory_relationships` rows **are** representable and migrate into `cao.links`.

**Why R2 exists.** Without the widened constraint, `migrate` without `--delete-source`
keeps the key by design, so every migrated memory would collide with its native original
and the default migration mode would be unusable — which is why refusing colliding keys was
rejected.

### U11 — `vault-cli`

**Ships.** `cao memory vault {status,scan,reconcile,rebuild,migrate}`. Read-only
`GET /memory/vault/status`. **And the `tui/src/catalog.rs` changes.**

**Does not ship.** Any MCP tool. An agent able to trigger a vault rescan can make CAO read
files on a schedule the operator did not choose.

### U12 — `vault-docs`

**Ships.** A new `docs/obsidian-vault.md` carrying the supported-boundary table verbatim,
the two-policy explanation, the full annotated settings example, the `project_id` pinning
recommendation, and the documented behavioral differences (`forget()` de-indexes;
`rebuild` resets vault access counts; export refuses vault scopes). Edits to existing
`docs/memory.md` (the `vault` origin and a pointer to the new page) and
`docs/configuration.md` (the `memory.vault` block and a `CAO_MEMORY_VAULT_ENABLED` row).
U1 owns the `docs/configuration.md` **Memory** section and its configuration surface; U12
owns the full user-facing vault document. `docs/settings.md` is a three-line "this document
has moved" stub, not a vault-documentation target. A vault section in both `SKILL.md` copies
is synchronized via `scripts/sync_skills.py`.

**Correction to the review:** `docs/settings.md` and `docs/configuration.md` were verified
present in this worktree. Neither is created.

**Watch item.** `scripts/validate_markdown_links.py` validates local links and heading
fragments across every **git-tracked** `.md`, so every relative link and anchor must
resolve once committed.

## Security-sensitive units

**Eight** units get an independent security review, separate from the functional review.

| Unit | What the review must confirm |
| --- | --- |
| U1 `vault-config` | `root` passes `resolve_and_validate_path`; no overlap with `MEMORY_BASE_DIR`, `CAO_HOME_DIR` or the graph export root; mappings cannot overlap; `federated`/`session` unmappable; `inject` without `index` refused; **`secret_gate` defaults to `reject` when absent, and `warn` + `inject: true` warns rather than passing silently** (R14); no path env-settable; every rule rejects rather than sanitizes; bounds not disableable; **and that read-mapping folders are NOT charset-restricted while `managed_folder` is** |
| U2 `vault-schema` | `source_kind` is NOT NULL with a server default, so the widened UNIQUE index is total; a duplicate **native** key is still rejected after the widening; the table rebuild is transactional; **the idempotence gate compares index COLUMN LISTS, not constraint names** (N5), and a second `init_db()` performs no second rebuild; all three secondary indexes survive (N6); `ck_related_keys_length` is absent and no data was truncated (R12); all **seventeen** sites carry the predicate; native-only consumers filter `source_kind = 'native'` |
| U5 `vault-reconcile` | **The three behavioural refusals are present and effective** — `wiki_healer` early refusal, `cleanup_service` refusal, and the `binding.py` warning/refusal surface. U2 owns the native predicates at the overlapping `wiki_lint`, `wiki_healer`, and `promotion_service` sites; each guard test is green on the current tree rather than an assertion inside an already-red class. The rebuild's deletes are scoped by `source_kind`/`origin`; all three audit events are in `NOWAIT_AUDIT_EVENTS`; the index-time secret gate quarantines under `reject` and its finding carries the pattern name only |
| U3 `vault-parse` | Frontmatter size-capped **before** parsing; safe loader; YAML anchors and aliases refused; `cao.links` capped; taxonomies imported not re-declared; invalid values quarantine rather than default; `cao.key` failing the shipped charset refused; the derived key is length-bounded by construction so truncation cannot decide identity; no parsed value interpolated into a prompt |
| U4 `vault-scan` | Symlinked components refused; **hardlinks refused**; always-excluded paths unconditional; exclusions applied **before** any open; the stability check not defeatable by a same-size write; non-UTF-8 quarantined; caps enforced; **F16 — this module owns its open sinks with the guard inline in the single positive form, passing bare `str`** |
| U6 `vault-recall` | Confinement re-asserted **inline at the sink**, independent of the row; a failing row is skipped and recorded, not raised; quarantined notes cannot become candidates; scope filtering unchanged; the API carries the vault-relative path only; `require_injectable` has no default; the body budget is enforced in the builder; **F16 as above** |
| U7 `vault-inject-gate` | Injection defaults deny; **the curator's recall input is gated, not its output**; an unidentifiable curator falls back rather than dispatching; unresolvable bindings exclude the candidate; the related fan-out at line 2854 is gated; `_is_memory_enabled()` not bypassed |
| U8 `vault-write` | Every target composed under `managed_folder`; a non-writable mapping fails rather than falling back; the secret gate runs; lock and temp files outside the vault; the conflict check inside the lock; only the `cao` frontmatter key rewritten; `forget()` never unlinks; **F16 as above** |
| U9 `vault-graph` | Node set uses the chokepoint with `status='indexed'`; **no quarantined node**; no path-shaped attribute; no new `EdgeType`; lands after U7 |

Each security review includes a **teeth test**: remove the guard, plant the attack, confirm
the leak, restore, confirm the leak is gone, and confirm `git diff` is empty afterwards.
The specific teeth tests are in [test-strategy.md](test-strategy.md).

## Cross-language and enumerated-set obligations

| Set | Where | Obligation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI command catalog | `tui/src/catalog.rs` — `CommandId`, `COMMAND_COUNT` (69 when written, 70 on `main` today), `DISPLAY_ORDER` (length is the type), two exhaustive matches, hard-coded counts in the module doc comment | Five new leaves means `COMMAND_COUNT` 75 after merging `main` and every site changes, in U11's pull request. `test/test_command_catalog_matches_click.py` asserts parity in **both** directions |
| Rust TUI build | `tui/` | U11 runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --locked` |
| **Agent-facing memory contract** | **`skills/cao-memory/SKILL.md` AND `src/cli_agent_orchestrator/skills/cao-memory/SKILL.md`** | Both copies exist and are held **byte-identical** by `test/test_skill_packaging_parity.py` via `filecmp.cmp`; sync with `python scripts/sync_skills.py`. Editing one copy turns the suite red. Its Forget section documents `memory_forget` as removing the topic file, which ruling R3 makes wrong — U8 corrects it, U12 adds the vault section. Revision 1 never mentioned skills at all |
| Relationship origins | `memory_relationship_service.py:55`; the comment at `database.py:169`; `docs/memory.md:301` | U5 adds `vault` to all three. It must **not** touch `_backfill_legacy_related_keys`, whose source text is hashed at `test/clients/test_memory_relationships_migration.py:119` |
| Edge types | `graph/models.py` `EdgeType`; `cao_mcp_apps/src/graph/types.ts:13`; web and MCP-apps graph tests | **No change.** An origin, not a type. Stated so nobody adds one helpfully |
| Audit events | `audit_log.py` `SYNC_AUDIT_EVENTS` / `NOWAIT_AUDIT_EVENTS`, unioned into the closed `AUDIT_EVENT_WHITELIST` | U5 registers three: `vault_reconcile_completed`, `vault_note_quarantined`, and `vault_secret_quarantined`. Registration precedes U5-B emission because an unlisted event is dropped silently, so an audit assertion would pass vacuously |
| `memory_metadata` columns and constraints | The model; the three `PRAGMA table_info(memory_metadata)` gates; `docs/memory.md`; **and the seventeen key-plus-scope query sites** across `memory_service.py`, `memory_reconciliation.py`, `memory_relationship_service.py`, `wiki_healer.py`, `promotion_service.py` and `wiki_lint.py` | U2. Verified: **no** `_REQUIRED_*_COLUMNS` equality guard on this table, so nothing fails loudly if a site is missed. Revision 2's list was 13 and mis-cited one line; four sites were added and one corrected in revision 3 |
| Secret-gate enforcement points | `store()`'s federated branch (existing); OKF export (existing); **and now reconcile** (ruling R5). One `mappings[].secret_gate` key governs the write and index points | U3 defines the finding, U4 applies it during the scan, U1 validates the enum |
| `forget()` return contract | `memory_service.py:2658`; seven call sites; `mcp_server/server.py:2047-2076` docstring and response; both `SKILL.md` copies | U8. `__bool__` is what keeps the seven call sites unedited |
| Memory settings keys | `get_memory_settings()` defaults; `set_memory_setting()`'s closed whitelist; `config_service.MemoryConfig`; `ENV_REGISTRY`; `docs/configuration.md` | U1 adds the nested `vault` object, one env var, and the `docs/configuration.md` Memory section. `set_memory_setting()` deliberately gains no vault key; U12 owns the user-facing vault document |
| Findings vocabulary | `services/vault/findings.py` only | One module, so parser, resolver, status view and documentation cannot drift |

## Suggested pull-request sequence

1. **U2 `vault-schema`** — first, alone, and reviewed hardest. It is the only unit that
   touches a shared table, and the nullable-discriminator mistake is the kind that passes
   every test while removing an invariant.
2. **U1 `vault-config`** — the security boundary, nothing else in the diff.
3. **U3 `vault-parse`** — untrusted parsing, no I/O in the diff.
4. **U4 `vault-scan`** — traversal, symlink and hardlink review.
5. **U5 `vault-reconcile`** — after this, derived state builds and rebuilds
   deterministically and nothing reads it. Carries the behavioural maintenance refusals,
   while U2's predicates keep native-only paths isolated before any vault row is readable. First
   demonstration-of-value checkpoint.
6. **U6 `vault-recall`** — the first unit that changes behavior for a configured user. AC3
   and AC4 become true here, and only because of the vault `Memory` builder.
7. **U7 `vault-inject-gate`** — immediately after U6. Policy constraint.
8. **U9 `vault-graph`** — after U7. Policy constraint.
9. **U8 `vault-write`** — AC7, AC8, and the `forget()` contract.
10. **U10 `vault-migrate`** — AC12.
11. **U11 `vault-cli`** — AC5's observability half, plus the Rust catalog.
12. **U12 `vault-docs`**.

U9 has moved from "any time after U5" to a fixed position. That is the visible consequence
of taking `Node.label` seriously as an exposure surface.

## What deliberately is not in release one

- **A file watcher.** Non-goal.
- **Multiple vaults.** [adr-002-vault-cardinality.md](adr-002-vault-cardinality.md).
- **Writes to any writable mapping rather than one managed folder.**
  [adr-003-read-and-write-surface.md](adr-003-read-and-write-surface.md).
- **`cao memory vault adopt`**, a single audited write of `cao.key` into one unmanaged
  note. [adr-006-identity-and-change-detection.md](adr-006-identity-and-change-detection.md).
  The strongest release-two candidate.
- **Per-note injection opt-out in frontmatter.**
  [adr-005-index-vs-injection-policies.md](adr-005-index-vs-injection-policies.md).
- **Block-reference and heading-anchor resolution; embed inlining; Dataview
  interpretation.** [adr-004-supported-markdown-boundary.md](adr-004-supported-markdown-boundary.md).
- **A CLI or HTTP setter for vault configuration.**
  [adr-007-configuration-surface.md](adr-007-configuration-surface.md).
- **An MCP tool for reconcile.** U11's note.
- **Per-project vault configuration in a repository file.**
  [adr-007-configuration-surface.md](adr-007-configuration-surface.md) alternative D.
- **OKF export of a vault-bound scope.** Refused rather than taught the binding, because
  teaching it would create a second read path into the vault and therefore a second
  chokepoint consumer. Open question 3 in [design.md](design.md).
- **Lint enrichment for vault-bound scopes.** Reported as unavailable in `GraphView.meta`
  rather than made to work, because `wiki_lint`'s detectors read bodies through a
  `MEMORY_BASE_DIR` containment check. Reflected in
  [traceability.md](traceability.md).
