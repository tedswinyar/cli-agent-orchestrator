# Agent Plugins dog-food — the feature installing CAO's own `cao` package
# through CAO's own new agent-plugin pipeline, asserting each step and exiting
# non-zero on ANY drift. This script IS the shift-left test that
# tools/record-dogfood-demo.mjs gates the recording on: a broken pipeline
# cannot print the PASS marker, so it cannot produce a green GIF.
#
# Two modes (per the handoff's offline-by-default / live-behind-a-flag rule):
#
#   OFFLINE (default): steps 1-5 run with NO provider binary, network, or
#     secrets. This is what CI records. Step 5's OpenCode half asserts the
#     written config shape (cao-ops -> enabled:false) — it proves CAO's OWN
#     write, per docs/issues/573-agent-plugins/opencode-verification.md.
#
#   LIVE (CAO_DOGFOOD_LIVE=1, needs the `opencode` binary): adds the
#     OBSERVATIONAL step 5 proof §2a demands — `opencode mcp list` reports the
#     removed server as `disabled` (○) and a sentinel wrapper confirms NO
#     subprocess is spawned for it, with a positive control that DOES spawn so
#     "no spawn" is observed, not assumed. `opencode` is not on CI, so this is
#     gated; the README states which assertion runs where.
#
# Everything runs under a scratch HOME + CAO_HOME_DIR + CAO_AGENTS_DIR so the
# operator's real ~/.aws/opencode/opencode.json, real Kiro agents dir, and real
# CAO home are never read or written. The scratch path is anonymous (a mktemp
# dir), so the PLUGIN_ROOT deliberately shown in step 3 carries no real home
# path — see CONTRIBUTING.md § "Recording test fixtures safely" (incident #436).
#
# Usage:
#   ./examples/agent-plugins/agent-plugins-dogfood/run.sh                 # offline
#   CAO_DOGFOOD_LIVE=1 ./examples/agent-plugins/agent-plugins-dogfood/run.sh  # + live OpenCode
