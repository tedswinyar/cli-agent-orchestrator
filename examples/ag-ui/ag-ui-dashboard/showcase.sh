# Drive the LIVE AG-UI generative-UI path against a running cao-server.
#
# Emits all six allow-listed components via POST /agui/v1/emit_ui (each -> a
# GENERATIVE_UI frame on the SSE stream) plus one OFF-LIST component (iframe)
# which the server-side allow-list refuses with HTTP 400 — proving an untrusted
# agent cannot inject arbitrary markup. Meanwhile it tails GET /agui/v1/stream
# and the PASS gate requires the frames to actually arrive: 6x HTTP 200,
# 1x HTTP 400, and >=6 GENERATIVE_UI frames captured off the live stream.
# Doubles as a deployment smoke test (non-zero exit on any miss).
#
# Requires: ./run.sh already running (or any cao-server with CAO_AGUI_ENABLED).
#
# Usage:
#   ./examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-dashboard/showcase.sh
#   CAO_AGUI_BASE=http://localhost:9889 ./examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-dashboard/showcase.sh
