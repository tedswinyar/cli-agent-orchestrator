# AG-UI stock client live demo (POST /agui/v1/run).
#
# Boots cao-server with CAO_AGUI_ENABLED=1 and mock_cli on PATH, then runs the
# pinned upstream stock client (@ag-ui/client HttpAgent, zero CAO wire code)
# against /agui/v1/run and verifies at least one frame is received from
# post-connect activity (AC3 / spec Requirement 13.4).
#
# This proves the run plane works with the official AG-UI SDK speaking the
# stock protocol (no CopilotKit page, no CAO-specific adapter).
#
# Requires Node.js (for the @ag-ui/client SDK). Usage:
#   ./examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-stock-client-live/run.sh

# trap delivers status 0 to the trap, so this demo could fail to launch and still
# report success. Only a ZERO status has to prove it was deliberate; nonzero exits
# (including Ctrl-C's 130) are failures either way and pass through untouched.

# INT/TERM keep their own trap so signal behaviour is unchanged; only EXIT is
