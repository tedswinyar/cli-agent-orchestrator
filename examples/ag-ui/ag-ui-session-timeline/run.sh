# Usage:

# Completion guard. On macOS bash 3.2 — the only bash here, and what
# `#!/usr/bin/env bash` resolves to — a `set -u` abort in a script that has an EXIT
# trap delivers status 0 to the trap, so this demo could fail to launch and still
# report success. Only a ZERO status has to prove it was deliberate; nonzero exits
# (including Ctrl-C's 130) are failures either way and pass through untouched.
#
# INT/TERM keep their own trap so signal behaviour is unchanged; only EXIT is
# rerouted through the guard, which still runs cleanup.
